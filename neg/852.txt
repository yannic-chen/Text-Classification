(Kitco News) - Gold prices have room to move higher even with the market facing growing headwinds as potential COVID-19 vaccines boost positive investor sentiment; however, commodity analysts at Societe Generale said that they are looking for prices to peak in the first half of 2021.
“We have for several months forecast that a return to ‘normalcy’ would be a bearish factor for gold,” the analysts said.
The analysts said that in their bullish gold scenario, they see gold prices reaching an all-time peak of $2,340 an ounce in the first quarter of 2021.
Having said that, bargain-hunting would surface too, limiting declines.”Looking at market dynamics, SocGen said that investor demand will remain the biggest driver for gold in 2021.
