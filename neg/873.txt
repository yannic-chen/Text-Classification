US Elections’ FX Market Impact: LosersBoth the DXY Index and gold prices have exhibited weakness in the wake of the US presidential election results.
Unfortunately for both gold prices and the US Dollar, they find themselves part of this latter category, making them clear losers as a result of the 2020 US presidential election.
Meanwhile, a rising US real yield environment, alongside real yields rising elsewhere, is bad for gold prices, plain and simple.
As a result, gold prices have traded through significant technical support levels in recent months, suggesting that a near-term top has been confirmed.
Gold prices have fallen to their lowest level since mid-July, clearing out the August swing low near 1818.09 in the process.
