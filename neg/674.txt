Gold markets have initially fallen during the trading session on Wednesday but found support at the same area that we have seen for quite some time, namely the $1850 level.
Ultimately, if we break down below here think there is even more support closer to the $1800 level, and that the market will be waiting for there to pick it back up.
After all, the 200 day EMA is sitting there and it is the level that we broke out from previously.
Beyond that, it is a large, round, psychologically significant figure and therefore I think it all adds up to an interesting place to start putting money to work.
