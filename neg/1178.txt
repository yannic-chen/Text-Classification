 Gold futures settled with a modest loss on Thursday, their second in a row, on expectations that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will soon authorize the emergency use of a COVID-19 vaccine.
"Vaccine news is bearish for gold," said Chintan Karnani, chief market analyst at Insignia Consultants.
The focus for the gold market will now shift to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week and news on additional stimulus, he said.
February gold GCG21, +0.20% fell $1.10, or nearly 0.1%, to settle at $1,837.40 an ounce.
