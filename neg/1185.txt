 XAU/USD prices remain subdued below its 50DMA and the $1840 level, despite risk-off flows.
A pick up in the DXY to just under 91.00 seems to be keeping precious metal bulls at bay.
XAU/USD hit highs of the day and tested its 50-day moving average which sits just below $1843 in recent trade but was unable to break above.
At present, the precious metal trades close to the $1840 mark and is marginally higher by about 0.2% or just under $3 on the day.
This mild pick up in USD seems to be the main factor preventing a broad risk-off-related rally in precious metals.
