(Bloomberg) -- Gold’s record-breaking bull market is facing an existential question after this month’s pharmaceutical breakthroughs: what happens to the rally once Covid-19 vaccines start rolling out?
By that logic, a beginning of the end of the crisis would signal a turning point for the rally.
The inflation question will be key to any outlook now, and it’s not the first time.
Macquarie Group Ltd. this week declared the “end of the cyclical bull market” and said prices have probably peaked.
Gold may also suffer as investors put money into other asset classes that stand to benefit from the recovering economy.
