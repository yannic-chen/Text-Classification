78.6-88.6 makes a good confluence with historical sellers.
We can see the zone which also shows historical selling, so I expect the price to reject.
However there is still range present in the gold markets and the final target is 1882.
If the market breaks lower than it will be a continuation of the downtrend.
As fas as bears are concerned, even 1925 could be good for selling, but I doubt the price will get there today.
