As you can see on the weekly chart, we have slammed into the $1800 level, which was the scene of a major breakout several months ago.
This typically helps gold, but the world is so “risk on” suddenly that even gold is being dumped.
If we are below it, then I believe the gold market will continue to struggle.
However, if the market holds above the $1800 level then it will continue to be a “buy on the dips” scenario.
The best thing that gold bulls could see at this point is stabilization and perhaps even a slow grind higher.
