Gold Price Talking PointsThe price of gold struggles to retain the rebound from the monthly low ($1851) even though the US Dollar remains on under pressure following the US election, and the precious metal appears to be moving to the beat of its own drum as it tracks the September range.
AdvertisementGold Prices to Watch as September Range Remains IntactThe price of gold failed to test the September low ($1849) earlier this month despite marking the largest single-day decline since August 11, and bullion may trade within a defined range ahead of the Federal Reserve’s last meeting for 2020 as the central bank is scheduled update the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).
Nevertheless, the decline from the record high ($2075) may turn out to be an exhaustion in the bullish trend rather than a change in market behavior as the RSI breaks out of the downward trend carried over from August and recovers from its lowest readings since March.
Need a break of the monthly high ($1966) to open up the $1971 (100% expansion) to $1985 (261.8% expansion) region, with the next area of interest coming n around $2016 (38.2% expansion) to $2025 (78.6% expansion).
