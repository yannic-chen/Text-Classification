Even after the declines marking the start of this week, contrarians continue to look for lower prices in gold.
But it is true that contrarians have been largely bearish since July, when gold market optimism reached hardly-ever-before-seen levels.
These are the conclusions I draw after analyzing the average recommended gold market exposure level among a set of short-term gold market timers who my firm has been monitoring on a daily basis since 2000.
This high of a reading is quite surprising from a contrarian point of view, given gold’s huge plunge to start this week.
Given how the gold timers behaved earlier this week, contrarians aren’t holding their breaths.
