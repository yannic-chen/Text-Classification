50-HMA at $1912 offers immediate cushion.
Gold (XAU/USD) drops 0.50% so far this Monday, reversing Friday’s surge to two-week highs of $1930 amid a broad US dollar rebound and a technical breakdown on the hourly chart.
The bright metal charted a symmetrical triangle breakdown in the last hour, following a close below the rising trendline support at $1924.
The move lower calls for a test of the next downside target aligned at the upward-sloping 50-hourly moving average (HMA) at $1912.
