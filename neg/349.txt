While traders look for reasons to buy gold and silver, there is no reason to step in here.
The precious metals remain in downtrends, with a higher probability of breaking to the downside until proven otherwise.
However, we know for sure that eventually, gold, silver and platinum will reverse and trend higher.
Traders must learn that trading is never based on hope or false promises, but price action and trend.
Hope is a losing proposition when it comes to trading; price and trend will guide you.
