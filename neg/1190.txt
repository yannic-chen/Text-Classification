 Reuters / Dado RuvicJPMorgan strategists said on Tuesday that gold will suffer in the long-term as more institutional investors adopt bitcoin.
JPMorgan also said bitcoin's intrinsic value will rise significantly over the coming months as mining activity improves.
"The adoption of bitcoin by institutional investors has only begun, while for gold its adoption by institutional investors is very advanced," JPMorgan said.
