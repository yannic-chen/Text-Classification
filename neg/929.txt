Gold faces rejection at the descending 5-day SMA hurdle.
Risk sentiment sours amid vaccine doubts but fails to boost the yellow metal.
Gold is struggling to draw bids despite the losses in the US stock futures and doubts about a coronavirus vaccine.
The yellow metal is currently trading largely unchanged on the day near $1,809, having faced rejection at the descending 5-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $1,813 early Friday.
Coupled with renewed signs of weakness in the US labor market, that looks to weighing over the S&P 500 futures and Asian stocks.
