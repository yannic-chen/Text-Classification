Iran’s gold market will be closed for two weeks starting today (Nov.21) in line with tougher lockdown measures announced by the government, head of Tehran Gold and Jewelry Union said.
"All shops selling gold, jewelry, silver, and gold coins operating along the streets or in malls are required to down their shutters," he said, pointing to the new restrictions to curb the Covid-19.
Iran's gold market was once forced to close for a month during March-April due to restrictions on almost all businesses when the plague was first officially announced.
Market observers say the lockdown could help boost unofficial trade in gold via online platforms.
However, gold prices in the domestic market are expected to continue declining due to lower prices in international markets and a sluggish domestic currency market, said Nader Bazr Afshan, a board member of TGJU.
