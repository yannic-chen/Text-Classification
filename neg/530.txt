Gold price dropped $100, or 4.5% on Monday as Pfizer announced that its COVID-19 vaccine is 90% effective.
The S&P 500 climbed 2.9%, the Dow is up 3.8%, and the NASDAQ is up only 1%, dragged down by companies that benefit from the work from home culture, like Zoom (-12%) and Netflix (-4%).
Peter Hug, global trading director of Kitco Metals, said that these moves factor in expectations that are a bit ‘premature’.
Hug noted that he is looking for bearish momentum to test gold’s support level of $1,850 an ounce.
“This kind of momentum could feed on itself as stop losses are triggered and people get called on margin that were long this position.
