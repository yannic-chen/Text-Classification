Spot gold fell 0.5% to $1,861.35 per ounce by 1311 GMT, having earlier hit its lowest since Nov. 9 at $1,854.60.
Gold is the victim of optimism over a coronavirus vaccine and a strengthening dollar pushing it towards the bottom end of its range, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said.
The dollar , considered a rival safe haven, was up 0.3% versus rivals, benefiting from uncertainties over a spike in new coronavirus cases in the United States and resultant restrictions.
Rising cases in Europe too pushed world stocks further away from record peaks scaled after promising vaccine announcements from Pfizer and Moderna.
"In the short term, (gold) prices may continue to drift lower towards $1,800," Vincent Tie, sales manager at Silver Bullion, said.
