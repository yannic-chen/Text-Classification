REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo/File PhotoSpot gold fell 0.1% to $1,887.40 per ounce by 1156 GMT, but held in a tight $9 range.
“Gold is mirroring the reaction of really everybody watching the evolution of the vaccines,” and the positive news is clearly keeping a cap on the gold market, said Robin Bhar, an independent analyst.
Gold shed as much as 1.3% on Monday after Moderna said its vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19 in a late-stage trial, becoming the second U.S. drugmaker after Pfizer to report results exceeding expectations.
Platinum slipped 0.2% to $923.45, while palladium shed 0.4% to $2,322.75.
“Strong car sales in China, a likely vaccine and recovering economic activity should keep the palladium market tight once again in 2021, lifting prices to $2,600/oz,” UBS analysts said in a note.
