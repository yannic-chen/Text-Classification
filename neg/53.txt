Gold has traded sideways for the last few weeks, but the price action is forming a bottom, said Frank Holmes, CEO of U.S.
Despite market volatility ahead of the November presidential election, Holmes maintains his $4,000 price target.
Gold has trended down from its August highs and has not broken past above $2,000 an ounce mid-August.
The outcome of the presidential election would not move the gold price either way, Holmes said.
“Some are betting on blue, some betting on red, and I’m betting on gold,” he said.
