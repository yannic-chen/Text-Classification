(Kitco News) - Gold and silver futures prices are moderately higher in early U.S. trading Friday, as some safe-haven demand has finally surfaced just days before the U.S. presidential elections.
December gold futures were last up $11.60 at $1,879.60 and December Comex silver was last up $0.335 at $23.695 an ounce.
Technically, the December gold futures bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage but are fading.
Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the September low of $1,851.00.
Silver bulls' next upside price objective is closing prices above solid technical resistance at the October high of $25.71 an ounce.
