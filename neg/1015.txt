 Support is seen near the July lows at 1,756.
Resistance is seen near the 10-day moving average at 1,859.
Short-term momentum has turned negative recently as the fast stochastic generated a crossover sell signal.
The current reading on the fast stochastic is 4, well below the oversold trigger level of 20, which could foreshadow a correction.
Medium-term momentum remains negative as the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram prints in the red with a declining trajectory which points to lower prices.
