(Kitco News) The yellow metal is losing last week's gains as the December Comex gold futures are back at trading below $1,900 an ounce on Tuesday.
"This shows that gold is having a hard time freeing itself from the $1,900 mark, which appears to be exerting a certain pull on its price," writes Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann.
Lack of optimism around the U.S. fiscal stimulus package in weighing on the precious metal this week.
This also makes it increasingly unlikely that any agreement will be reached before the presidential elections in three weeks' time," Briesemann says.
This is triggering a positive response in the U.S. dollar, which puts downward pressure on gold, the analyst adds.
