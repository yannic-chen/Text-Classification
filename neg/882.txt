Gold futures on Wednesday booked a meager gain, as the precious metal attempted to recover from a series of sharp declines that were prompted partly by progress on vaccines and treatments for the economy-disrupting coronavirus.
December gold GC00, -0.03% GCZ20, -0.03% added 90 cents, or less than 0.1%, to settle at $1,805.50 an ounce.
The precious metal is on track for a weekly decline of almost 4%.
