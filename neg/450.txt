The gold price will benefit from either party’s win, but short term, the yellow metal faces bearish pressure, is the conclusion of Gary Wagner, editor of the GoldForecast.com.
Because he is a Republican, he still will need to pass fiscal stimulus in terms of an aid package.
Either way, gold is set to rise should there be a fiscal stimulus package, Wagner said.
“Based on the moving averages alone, we have to say we have a bearish slant to a gold market right now,” Wagner said.
While gold has historically been regarded as a safe haven asset and moves in the opposite direction of risk assets, this inverse correlation has not always held; case in point, last week, gold has fallen several times with equities, and on Monday and Tuesday this week, gold has risen in tandem with stocks.
