Treasury Yields Fall Amid Fed and Treasury Disagreement Over Emergency Funding ProgramU.S. Treasury yields declined on Friday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin decided to let several of the Federal Reserve’s emergency funding programs on December 31.
Falling yields made the U.S. Dollar a less-desirable asset and dollar-denominated gold rose slightly in response to the weaker greenback.
Treasury yields slipped after Mnuchin issued a letter on Thursday that said he would not extend the Fed’s program that used Congress’ CARES Act funds.
When this move is combined with the lack of fiscal stimulus, it’s hard to paint a bullish picture for the gold market.
If gold can’t rally when Treasury yields are falling and the dollar is trending lower then this probably means it’s in the hands of strong sellers.
