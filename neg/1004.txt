 Gold markets have fallen a bit during the trading session on Monday to kick off the week on the back foot yet again.
At this point, we are getting a bit overextended to the downside, but I also believe that there are multiple reasons why gold is starting to sell off.
The most obvious reason of course is the idea that the “risk on” trade has people jumping away from the safe haven trade of gold and stepping out on the risk spectrum.
This is because I think that ultimately the falling US dollar will give gold a boost.
We clearly do not have that yet, so it is probably best to simply sit on the sidelines and wait.
