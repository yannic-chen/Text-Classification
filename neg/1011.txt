Gold slipped on Monday and was on track for its worst month in four years, as optimism over a coronavirus vaccine-led economic rebound that propelled equities to record highs dulled the metal's safe-haven appeal.
Spot gold fell 1.2% to $1,766.26 per ounce by 0301 GMT.
Gold is down 5.9% so far this month, its biggest monthly decline since November 2016.
Vaccine optimism drove the dollar to a more than two-year low and put world stocks on course for a record month of gains.
Silver slipped 3.2% to $21.96 per ounce, while platinum fell 0.9% to $954.64 and palladium was down 0.4% at $2,416.22.
