Gold markets have fallen rather hard during the trading session on Monday, breaking through the crucial $1850 level.
Now that we are below there, I think there are much more significant areas below that we could go looking towards, most notably the $1800 level.
That of course weighs upon the value of gold, as it is most typically priced in US dollars and used as a hedge against them.
That being the case, I think that we get an opportunity to pick up gold at better prices.
I have no interest in shorting gold, although I fully anticipate that we drop another $20 from where we are right now.
