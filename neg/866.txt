(Kitco News) - The gold market is seeing little reaction to the latest economic data showing U.S. consumers depended heavily on credit as government assistance wound down last month.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis said that personal income dropped 0.7% in October, significantly missing expectations.
“The decrease in personal income in October was led by a decrease in government social benefits,” the report said.
The gold market is seeing little reaction to the dismal income data and continues to struggle to find new bullish momentum.
Although at first blush, the latest economic report seems bearish for gold.
