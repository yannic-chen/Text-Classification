Expectations of imminent vaccines weigh on the safe-haven dollar, offering some support to gold.
A dense cluster of resistances are lined up around $1875, where the SMA10 one-day coincides with Fibonacci 23.6% one-day and previous high four-hour.
Buyers will then aim for the confluence of the Fibonacci 61.8% one-week and Pivot Point one-day R1 at $1882.
However, the Pivot Point one-day R2 at $1891 remains the level to beat for the bulls.
A sharp drop towards the intersection of the previous week low and Pivot Point one-day S2 at $1852/50 cannot be ruled if the bears extend control below the $1860 level.
