Successful vaccines could spell an end to gold's run up as investors look elsewhereGold requires a reason to continue to be at these elevated levels.
Gold is viewed by many as the archetypal haven asset, inevitably driven higher in times of turmoil.
"Risks to gold prices remain skewed to the upside given expectations of loose monetary policy, with real rates remaining low or negative globally," said Suki Cooper, a precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered.
Spot gold traded at $1,873 an ounce on Monday and is heading for the biggest annual gain in a decade.
Gold may also suffer as investors put money into other asset classes that stand to benefit from the recovering economy.
