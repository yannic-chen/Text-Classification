(Kitco News) - Gold futures prices are sharply down and hit a five-month low in early U.S. trading Friday.
December gold futures were last down $30.40 at $1,772.80 and December Comex silver was last down $0.937 at $22.425 an ounce.
When that key near-term level was breached the bottom did indeed fall out of the gold futures market.
It appeared to work for gold and silver market bears today.
Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at $1,700.00.
