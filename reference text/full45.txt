Technical analysis

Gold prices rallied on Monday bouncing near support at the 10-day moving average at 1,887. Resistance is seen near the 50-day moving average at 1,945. The 10-day moving average crossed through the 50-day moving average which means a short-term downtrend is in place. Medium-term momentum has turned positive as the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) generated a crossover buy signal. This occurs as the MACD line (the 12-day moving average minus the 26-day moving average) crosses above the MACD signal line. Short-term momentum has turned positive as the fast stochastic recently generated a crossover buy signal. The current reading on the fast stochastic is 46, rebound from the oversold trigger level of 20 which is a sign of accelerating positive momentum.
