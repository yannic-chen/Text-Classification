Treasury yields took a break from their recent climb, declining as riskier assets dropped. A weaker than expected September New Home Sales report weighed on yields, allowing gold prices to remain buoyed. Gold implied volatility which measures how much options traders believe the price will move remains elevated at 21% well off the highs seen in March near 55, but well off the average in 2019 which was closer to 13%.
