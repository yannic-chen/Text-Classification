Gold prices edged higher for a third straight day early Wednesday, pushing the precious metal further above a one-week peak and toward a five-week high, as a rise in bond yields was overshadowed by weakness in the U.S. dollar.

However, some experts warn that the precious metal is vulnerable to sharp pullbacks, amid a period of recently listless trade, leading into the presidential elections in the U.S. set for Nov. 3, and as bond yields gain more altitude.

Chintan Karnani, chief market analyst at Insignia Consultants, says that a rise in Treasury prices, a firmer dollar or a selloff in industrial metals, all could ignite a sharp move in bullion and points to a number of technical levels that traders need to watch.

“What gold needs to do to rise further… gold has to trade over $1930-$1935 zone to rise to $1960,” the analyst said. “Key price is $1930… if gold does not break $1935 by tomorrow then get ready for a move back to $1880,” he cautioned.

Early Wednesday the 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.812% was up 2.4 basis points to around 0.81%. But gold investors appeared to be focusing on a 0.4% move lower in the dollar, as gauged by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.54% .

Rising yields can undercut appetite for gold, which doesn’t bear a coupon, while a weakening dollar can stoke demand in dollar-pegged precious metals among buyers using alternative currencies.
