Gold markets have broken down a bit during the trading session on Thursday, slicing through the 50 day EMA. That of course is an indicator that a lot of people pay attention to. Ultimately, I think that the fact that it has gone flat tells you that gold is not quite ready to take off to the upside for a bigger move quite yet. However, the $1900 level underneath is significant support, just as the $1850 level should offer support given enough time. I do believe that we are looking at a scenario where the markets will continue to see a lot of choppy behavior, and perhaps reaction to the stimulus stocks or possibly the lack of progress.

The knock on effect of course is that the US dollar strengthens, which weighs upon the strength of the gold market, at least in the short term. I believe that we will continue to see more downward pressure than up, but longer-term is still very bullish for gold as central banks and governments around the world look to flood the financial system, which of course has people looking for “hard assets.” Gold is essentially the ultimate hard asset.
