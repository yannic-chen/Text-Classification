(Kitco News) - Gold and silver futures prices are sharply lower in midday U.S. trading Wednesday. Gold dropped to a four-week low and silver hit a three-week low. The precious metals are getting pounded by a stronger U.S. dollar index at mid-week. Much to the consternation of the bulls, the safe-haven metals can’t catch a bid despite the keener risk aversion in the marketplace, as seen by a big sell off in the U.S. stock market. December gold futures were last down $29.90 at $1,882.00 and December Comex silver was last down $1.155 at $23.41 an ounce.

Rising Covid-19 pandemic infections in the U.S. and Europe, as well as other parts of the world, are fanning worries new lockdowns are coming this winter, even though they may not be as extreme as seen last spring. Europe is already starting to ramp up its quarantine of some business activities. Concerns about the U.S. presidential election and the transfer of power if Joe Biden wins are also in the marketplace. No new U.S. government financial stimulus package for American citizens is in sight and that’s also adding to downbeat attitudes in the stock markets.

The important outside markets today are fully bearish for the metals, as see the U.S. dollar index is sharply higher. Meantime, Nymex crude oil prices are solidly lower and trading around $37.25 a barrel. If crude oil continues to head south, it’s likely most raw commodity markets will have an anchor on any upside price action. Oil prices are close to hitting multi-month lows, which would produce serious near-term technical damage.
