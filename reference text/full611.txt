A Reuters tally showed novel COVID-19 cases soared by more than 100% in 13 U.S. states in the past two weeks, while the global tally crossed 52.45 million, underpinning the need for more stimulus.

Last week, December Comex gold settled at $1886.20, $65.50 or -3.36%.

Despite the steep sell-off, gold prices remained underpinned by the prospect of continued monetary stimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the hopes of fresh fiscal stimulus from the U.S. Government.

Beware of Companies Announcing Vaccine Results

Given the reaction in the market to the Pfizer news on Monday, gold investors have to be wary of other companies announcing trial data in the coming weeks. Any news touting a successful trial could put more pressure on gold prices.

In addition to the Pfizer vaccine news, Moderna said on Wednesday it has enough data for a first interim analysis of the late-stage trial of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine, which should help determine the vaccine’s efficacy.

The announcement from Moderna had little effect on gold prices because the skeptics are out there. Despite the huge stock market rally and gold market plunge last Monday, traders are now focusing on the many hurdles before vaccines get into widespread use and COVID-19 is brought under control.

According to Bloomberg, questions about production, distribution, and most important, the capability of the shot itself still need to be answered. Pfizer’s late-stage trial started less than four months ago, and how long the vaccine will confer protection is unknown.

“The key question still centers upon time, says Michael Kinch, a drop development expert and associate vice chancellor at Washington University in St. Louis. “Will time tell us that the protection remains useful for the larger population?

Bloomberg also added, “Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine has shown more than 90% efficacy in early tests. But there will be shortages of any successful shot, so masks aren’t going away anytime soon.”
