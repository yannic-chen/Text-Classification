 Gold prices have made a strong start to December as growing optimism over a U.S stimulus deal and on-going dollar devaluation continue to boost the metal's appeal as an inflation hedge.

Gold Prices are up over 5%, so far this month – trading at their highest since November 23.

With less than a month left in 2020, bipartisan support for a new $908 billion economic stimulus deal continues to grow, with President-elect Joe Biden rallying behind the bill and urging Congress to reach a compromise that delivers more financial aid before year-end.

Meanwhile, the case for more Federal Reserve action to support the slowing economy was boosted by a disappointing November U.S employment report.

Traders' attention has now shifted to the upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve meeting for signs of whether the Fed will step up its stimulus efforts – should Congress fail to pass an emergency COVID-19 relief package before the end of 2020.
