As the Gazette reported recently, Sen. Chuck Grassley has officially finished 40 years of meetings in every county every year since his election to the Senate. If elected to Congress, I will make multiple visits to every county in the district every year. Sen. Grassley has set the gold standard for American representative government, even if his political opponents don’t want to admit it.

There’s no reason to make accessibility and accountability a partisan issue. And Grassley’s critics should think twice before taking swipes at a tradition that’s fundamentally improved how we do politics in Iowa. Bemoaning a lack of access to Senator Grassley is like complaining that the rain is too wet. He’s as reliable as they come.

For my part, I’ll do everything I can to follow that example and uphold the gold standard that Iowans now expect from elected leaders—even if there are naysayers. It’s also why I’ve accepted additional debates with Rep. Abby Finkenauer, which she refuses to respond to. Voters deserve to make an informed decision and should question Rep. Finkenauer’s recSord in this regard rather than Sen. Grassley’s. Sen. Grassley holds weekly media availabilities; Rep. Finkenauer does not. If elected, I will work tirelessly to be a transparent servant leader on behalf of Iowans in the 1st Congressional District.
