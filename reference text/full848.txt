Technical analysis

Gold prices broke down on Tuesday as the downtrend accelerated following Monday’s breakdown which pushed through trend support near 1,860 which is now seen as resistance. Additional resistance is seen near the 10-day moving average at 1,865. Support is seen near the July lows at 1,756. Short-term momentum has turned negative recently as the fast stochastic generated a crossover sell signal. The current reading on the fast stochastic is 8, well below the oversold trigger level of 20, which could foreshadow a correction. Medium-term momentum remains negative as the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram prints in the red with a declining trajectory which points to lower prices.
