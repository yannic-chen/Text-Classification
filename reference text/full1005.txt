 Gold futures fell on Monday, with prices for the most-active contract posting a fourth consecutive monthly loss. Gold demand has weakened as "many investors are also preferring to dabble with cryptocurrencies and buy industrial metals, such as copper," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. However, "gold will likely see strong support in mid-December as the stimulus trade will be boosted" by the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve, he said. February gold GCG21, -0.45% declined by $7.20, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,780.90 an ounce. Prices based on the most-active contract marked their lowest settlement since July 1 and lost roughly 5.6% from the end of October, according to FactSet data.
