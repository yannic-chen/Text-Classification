Short-Term Outlook

Based on the price action the last three days, the direction of the December Comex gold market on Friday is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the pivot at $1912.20.

Bearish Scenario

A sustained move under $1912.20 will indicate the presence of sellers. If this move creates enough downside momentum, then look for the selling to possibly extend into the main 50% level at $1889.70, followed closely by $1885.00 and the main bottom at $1877.10. The latter is a potential trigger point for an acceleration into a potential support cluster at $1851.00 to $1842.60.

Bullish Scenario

A sustained move over $1912.20 will signal the presence of buyers. If this generates enough upside momentum then look for buyers to take a shot at $1939.40. This is a potential trigger point for an acceleration to the upside with $1970.10 the primary upside target.
