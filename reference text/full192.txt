(Kitco News) - One signal of a bull market still in progress is when dips are viewed as buying opportunities by many traders. Such is the case in the gold and silver markets, as today’s early losses were regained in gold, and silver regained most of its earlier losses. To put it another way, both metals continue to show resilience when the market bears do attack. Gains in both metals were again limited today by a higher U.S. dollar index on this day. December gold futures were last up $0.20 at $1,907.50 and December Comex silver was last down $0.165 at $24.23 an ounce.
