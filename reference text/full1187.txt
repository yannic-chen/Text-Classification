 Gold markets have initially pulled back during the trading session on Friday, but then turned around to show some signs of strength again as the $1825 level has offered support for the last three days in a row. Ultimately, the market is likely to continue seeing more of a “buy on the dips” type of attitude, but that does not mean that we are going to shoot straight up in the air. Quite frankly, I think that this is a recovery that is going to take a certain amount of time, and therefore it is very possible that we could go looking towards the 50 day EMA above.

That is an area where I think we would see a little bit of a pushback near the $1870 level, but I do think that eventually we can break through there, perhaps reaching towards the $1900 level. Breaking above there, then the market is likely to go looking towards the $1950 level. Longer-term, I believe that we will revisit the highs again, due to stimulus talks in the United States finally getting solved. I do not expect this market to suddenly explode to the upside, but I think that this is more of a bit of a choppy upward slope just waiting to happen.
