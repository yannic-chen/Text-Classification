It’s key to knowing that since gold prices bounced off from a price band of $1,852/ounce to near $1,880/ounce at last week’s trading session, the bulls seem to be suppressed on conflicting macros playing on mixed signals that include CO VID-19 vaccines, the second wave and most importantly the recent tussle between the US Fed Reserve Bank and U.S Treasury, left gold traders clueless and literally frozen on the next move to take.

Gold traders are presently having it rough, in spite of the greenback’s often decline amid the bias that once Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine hits the market, market confidence among global investors might push the safe-haven asset below the $1,800 support level, as it now seems very likely that such vaccine would get an approval for emergency use from the Food Drug Administration.
