Gold markets have rallied a bit during the trading session on Tuesday as more optimism of a quick election result has crept into the markets. Whether or not that is true is totally irrelevant, because this comes down to the US dollar either rising or falling. The argument on Wall Street is that the Biden administration would be extraordinarily loose with stimulus, but then again so will Trump. The idea is eventually the US dollar gets crushed. However, there are other things out there moving markets.

Once we get past the election, I suspect that we may get a bit of a pullback in gold as the US dollar may get a little bit of a bid. This will be especially true if the elections do not get called rather quickly. Quite frankly, I do not see that happening but that is the scenario right now. At this point time, is very likely that the market will continue to back and fill, meaning that we will probably drop yet again. I think that the $1850 level will be massive support, followed by the $1800 level.
