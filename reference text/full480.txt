Gold markets have rallied significantly during the trading session on Thursday, reaching towards the $1950 level rather early. However, just $10 above the market has seen a lot of supply, so it will be interesting to see if that holds. There is an entire “zone of resistance” extending from the $1960 level to the $2000 level, so signs of exhaustion will be more than likely an opportunity to take profit. You could sell if you wanted to, but that is more of a short-term trading environment, and one that would be dangerous to say the least.

The FOMC Meeting of course will have a significant influence on what goes on with the US dollar, but quite frankly the Federal Reserve has been telegraphing for a while that it does not have too much left that it can do without fiscal stimulus. Senate leader Mitch McConnell has suggested that perhaps stimulus would be the first priority when Congress got back to work, but the reality is that the stimulus will be much smaller than originally anticipated. Because of this, you may actually make more money buying gold and other currencies than the US dollar.
