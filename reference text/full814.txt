Technical analysis

Gold prices broke down on Monday pushing through trend line support near 1,860 which is now seen as resistance. Additional resistance is seen near the 10-day moving average at 1,872. Support is seen near the June lows at 1,697. Short-term momentum has turned negative recently as the fast stochastic generated a crossover sell signal. The current reading on the fast stochastic is 12, well below the oversold trigger level of 20, which could foreshadow a correction. Medium-term momentum remains negative as the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram prints in the red with a declining trajectory which points to lower prices.
