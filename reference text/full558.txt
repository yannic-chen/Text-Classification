Daily Swing Chart Technical Analysis

The main trend is down according to the daily swing chart. A trade through $1848.00 will signal a resumption of the downtrend with $1819.30 the next potential downside target.

A trade through $1966.10 will change the main trend to up. This is highly unlikely, but there is room to the upside for a normal 50% to 61.8% of Monday’s sell-off.

The main range is $1690.10 to $2089.20. The market is currently trading inside its retracement zone at $1889.70 to $1842.60, indicating investor indecision.

The minor range is $1966.10 to $1848.00. Its 50% level at $1907.10 is the next likely upside target. Since the main trend is down, sellers could come in on the initial test of this price.
