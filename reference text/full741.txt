Gold markets have pulled back during the course of the week only to turn around and form a bit of a hammer. By doing so, it looks as if we are ready to continue to see buyers on dips, as the $1850 level continues to be massive support. That being the case, I think it is only a matter of time before we see people jumping in to pick up bits and pieces of value. Ultimately, this is a market that I think is trying to build up a bigger move over the longer term, and it could take quite some time to get the bigger move playing itself out.

Central banks around the world continue to flood the markets with liquidity so it is difficult to imagine how precious metals will not find buyers jumping in. Ultimately, we probably go looking towards the $2000 level, and beyond. However, that does not necessarily mean that we are going to shoot straight up in the air. I think it is going to continue to be more of a grind higher than anything else, and at this point in time I have no interest in trying to short this market. After all, central banks will continue to keep easy monetary policy and that of course is fuel to the fire.
