Gold May Have A Good Chance To Rebound After Recent Sell-Off

The main victim of the recent market optimism was the precious metal segment. Gold and silver were under significant pressure as traders sold safe haven assets.

However, more stimulus means more money-printing which is bullish for gold. In addition, Janet Yellen as the next Treasury Secretary will likely implement a very dovish strategy while the Fed may keep rates at the bottom until 2024. This is a setup for a weaker U.S. dollar and strong gold.

It will be interesting to see whether traders will rush to buy gold near the $1800 level or wait until it gets closer to the stronger support at $1750. Shares of gold miners have already received some support in the previous trading session which indicates that there’s some interest in gold-related instuments at current levels.

Oil Rally Will Get Tested By Reality

Bad news are coming from Europe – while lockdowns are set to end, European countries will keep many anti-virus measures in place until mid-January to contain the spread of the virus. Germany’s Merkel is even thinking about closing ski resorts all over Europe.

The continued problems on the coronavirus front in Europe will lead to weak demand for oil. It remains to be seen whether growth in Asia will be able to offset this weakness and push oil prices to higher levels.

Oil-related stocks enjoyed a very strong rebound in November and pullback risks are high unless oil manages to continue its rally. Today, oil is moving lower in a thin market, but the real test is due next week when all traders return to their desks after holidays.
