(Kitco News) - The gold market is holding on to support above $1,900 an ounce but sees little reaction as more workers than expected file for unemployment benefits.

Thursday, the Labor Department said that 840,000 million Americans filed for first-time U.S. jobless claims in the week to Saturday. The rise comes as economists were looking for a small decline with a consensus forecast for 820,000 claims.

The previous week’s unemployment data was revised up by 12,000 claims to 849,000, the report said.

The latest weaker-than-expected employment data is not providing much momentum for gold prices. December gold futures last traded at $1,905.20 an ounce, up 0.62% on the day.

The four-week moving average for new claims – often viewed as a more reliable measure of the labor market since it smooths out week-to-week volatility – was 857,000, down 13,250 claims from the previous week.

Continuing jobless claims, the number of people already receiving benefits and reported with a one-week delay, fell to 10.976 million, for the week ending Sept. 26. Continuing claims dropped by 1 million from the previous week.
