(Kitco News) - Gold and silver futures prices are posting solid gains at midday Tuesday, but still have a way to go to reclaim Monday’s strong losses that produced some near-term chart damage. The precious metals bulls are now working to stabilize their markets and made some progress today. December gold futures were last up $27.80 at $1,882.30 and December Comex silver was last up $0.839 at $24.54 an ounce.

The gold market Monday saw strong losses that were the worst in seven years and pushed prices to 3.5-month lows. Gold market bulls on Tuesday were possibly focusing more on the economic impact of record-setting monetary stimulus measures that have been enacted by central banks over the past six months, and probably more stimulus in the coming months. This scenario seems to be inviting some serious price inflation down the road—especially as recovering major world economies shift into higher gears in the coming months.

Global stock markets were mostly up overnight, whiled U.S. stock indexes are also mixed to weaker at midday. The marketplace euphoria is not quite as strong Tuesday, following Monday’s news that a successful vaccine has been found for Covid-19. While that news is certainly a bright light in a dark period for the world, the markets on Tuesday are realizing there is still a very rough patch that lies ahead in dealing with the pandemic, both for major economies and human health.

U.S. Treasury bond and note yields have risen to eight-month highs this week, on the prospects for a solid U.S. economic recovery in 2021. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is currently fetching 0.94%.

The U.S. dollar index is near steady early today on a corrective bounce after hitting a nine-week low Monday. The other important outside market sees crude oil prices higher and trading around $41.00 a barrel.
