Gold markets broke down a bit during the trading session on Tuesday, slicing through the $1900 level. By looking at the size of the candlestick, the market looks very negative. Ultimately, the $1850 level underneath is a potential target due to the fact that it is where the recent bounce occurred. At that point, I think there is a significant amount of interest in that area, and support as well. If we can break down below the level, then the market is likely to go down to the $1800 level, an area that I think will attract a lot of attention.

Furthermore, the 200 day EMA is approaching that level, and ultimately, there is a lot of noise in that general vicinity, and therefore I think that the buyers will be attracted that level as it was the scene of a major breakout. At this point, the 200 day EMA is a longer-term trend signal as well, so a lot of interest will be seen in that general vicinity. Quite frankly, if we break down below there then gold is in serious trouble for a longer-term move to the downside.
