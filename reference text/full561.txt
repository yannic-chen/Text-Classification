With the gold cycle indicator (GCI) nearing minimum cycle bottoming, we could see a bottom any day. The last time the GCI fell below 100 was in March. On Wednesday, it finished at 114. Note- minimum cycle bottoming means prices have met the minimum technical requirements for a 6-month low – prices could drop further.

Our educational portfolio for premium members uses an accumulation strategy based on GCI readings. In a nutshell, when it drops below 100, I begin adding to our precious metal’s portfolio. It was designed to take the stress out of trading.
