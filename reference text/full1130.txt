 Gold markets have rallied a bit during the trading session on Tuesday to break above the 50 day EMA. Ultimately, this is a market that is going to go looking towards the $1900 level, which is a large, round, psychologically significant figure, and a target for buyers. That is an area where we have seen a lot of selling, so I think that it is only a matter of time before we get a pullback, but that pullback will more than likely end up offering a buying opportunity.

To the downside, I believe that the 200 day EMA is going to be an indicator that a lot of people will pay attention to especially considering that it is sitting at the $1800 level. The $1800 level is of course a large number that people will be paying quite a bit of attention to due to the fact that it was the scene of a major breakout previously. I do like the idea of buying dips going forward and I have no interest in shorting gold. The US dollar falling will continue to help gold, and I think that it is only a matter of time before that continues.
