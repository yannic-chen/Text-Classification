(Kitco News) The yellow metal is losing last week's gains as the December Comex gold futures are back at trading below $1,900 an ounce on Tuesday. "This shows that gold is having a hard time freeing itself from the $1,900 mark, which appears to be exerting a certain pull on its price," writes Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann. Lack of optimism around the U.S. fiscal stimulus package in weighing on the precious metal this week. "Members of the House of Representatives were informed not to expect any action this week. This also makes it increasingly unlikely that any agreement will be reached before the presidential elections in three weeks' time," Briesemann says. This is triggering a positive response in the U.S. dollar, which puts downward pressure on gold, the analyst adds. "The further spread of coronavirus is presumably one reason why gold is not falling more sharply. The development of a coronavirus vaccine also appears to be encountering some hurdles: a U.S. pharma company has had to pause its trial phase because a test subject fell ill for as yet unexplained reasons. This is leading to uncertainty among market participants."
