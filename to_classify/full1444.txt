 Technical analysis

Gold prices moved higher, breaking out above trend line resistance and testing resistance near the November highs near 1,950. A close above this level will lead to a test of the August highs at 2,075. Support is near the 10-day moving average near 1,892. The 10-day moving average crossed above the 50-day moving average, which means a medium-term uptrend is now in place. Short-term momentum has turned positive as the fast stochastic generated a crossover buy signal. The current reading on the fast stochastic is 95, above the overbought trigger level of 80, foreshadowing a correction. Medium-term momentum is positive as the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram prints in the black with a positive trajectory, which points to higher prices.
