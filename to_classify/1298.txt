 The equities markets have reached a top and are due for a pullback by about 15% - 20% in the New Year, said Gareth Soloway, chief market strategist at InTheMoneyStocks.com.
While the S&P 500 has broken out above its multi-year trendline, history suggests that every time this has happened in the last few years, a correction follows, Soloway noted.
“When unemployment was maximum in March, 2009, we actually got a big market move, percentage-wise, during that period.
As unemployment comes down, you actually see the market gains coming down, so the idea here is that the market is always forward-thinking.
“That’s why I think you could be in a multi-year high.”
