 Dado Ruvic/ReutersCrypto investment firm Grayscale enjoyed a 900% surge in assets under management last year as bitcoin's rally drove multibillion-dollar inflows.
Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust drove most of the inflows, growing to $17.5 billion AUM from $1.8 billion.
Crypto investment firm Grayscale saw assets under management surge tenfold in 2020 as wider adoption of bitcoin drove billions into its trusts.
The move stands to end Grayscale's "effective monopoly" on institutional investors' flows and pull cash out of its trusts, JPMorgan analysts said Friday.
"A cascade of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust outflows and a collapse of its premium would likely have negative near-term implications for bitcoin," they added in a note to clients.
