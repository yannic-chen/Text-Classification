(Kitco News) - Gold and silver futures prices are moderately higher in early U.S. trading Monday. The safe-haven metals are catching a bid to start the trading week as there are now more cross-currents in the marketplace than seen recently. Some perceived bargain hunting is also featured in gold and silver after their prices scored sharp declines last Friday. February gold futures were last up $7.40 at $1,842.80 and March Comex silver was last up $0.278 at $24.915 an ounce.

Global stock markets were mostly weaker overnight. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward lower openings when the New York day session begins. Trader and investor risk appetite is dented to start the trading week. A downbeat U.S. unemployment report last Friday and the aftermath of the U.S. Capitol riot have combined with the still-raging Covid-19 pandemic are weighing on the marketplace. The trading and investment climate “is a little bumpier” than at this time last week, said one market analyst.

The key “outside markets” today see the U.S. dollar index solidly up. Said one market analyst in a morning email dispatch: “ Shorting the dollar was the most recommended trade in currency markets heading into 2021. However, rising (U.S. government bond) yields could now lead to a rethinking of this strategy. If the yield curve becomes steeper and differentials become much wider, expect to see a strong recovery in the dollar despite the new billions in expected stimulus. According to the latest CFTC data, we are already seeing a trimming of long positions in major currencies (futures) against the greenback.”

Meantime, Nymex crude oil futures prices are weaker and are trading around $51.75 a barrel. Profit taking is featured after crude oil prices last Friday hit a 10-month high.

The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield is currently fetching 1.103%.

U.S. economic data due for release Monday is light and includes the employment trends index.
