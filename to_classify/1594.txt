 (Kitco News) - The gold market once again remains caught in a tug of war between expectations of an improving economy and rising inflation pressures as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office.
Daniel Pavilonis, senior commodities broker with RJO Futures said that he also sees gold prices currently in a wait-and-see mode as market dynamics start to change.
However, he added that he still sees gold prices pushing above $2,000 an ounce as he expects inflation will be a bigger influence for investor than growth.
On the downside, Melek said that he expects critical support around $1,767 an ounce hold and signal a near-term bottom for the market.
Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM said that he is also watching the U.S. dollar for where gold is headed next.
