 GOLD is in uptrend and I expect continuation of the bullish move. We can see the rounded bottom as an additional cue.

The POC zone should spike the price up. Continuation above W L3 camarilla should happen today. 1875 zone is where the buyers are.Targets are 1890 and 1902. The final target is 1916. Only the move below 1850 could change the trend. At this point buying the dips is the option and gold is poised to go higher.
