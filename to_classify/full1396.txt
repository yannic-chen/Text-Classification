 In 2002/2003, the US was coming out of recession, just like now. The recent $900-billion relief package will not be the last. I expect one or two more programs next year – this should continue to deflate the dollar and push hard assets higher.

MEDIUM-TERM GOLD FORECAST

GOLD DAILY

The 6-month cycle in gold likely bottomed at $1767.20 in November. Prices are climbing the “wall of worry,” and I expect a breakout above the intermediate trendline within the next 1 to 3-weeks. The trigger event to push gold through the trendline could arrive any day, but the time surrounding the January 5th run-off election in Georgia is of particular interest. The minimum target on a breakout is $2300 for this leg higher.
