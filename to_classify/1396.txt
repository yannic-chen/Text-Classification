MEDIUM-TERM GOLD FORECASTGOLD DAILYThe 6-month cycle in gold likely bottomed at $1767.20 in November.
Prices are climbing the “wall of worry,” and I expect a breakout above the intermediate trendline within the next 1 to 3-weeks.
The trigger event to push gold through the trendline could arrive any day, but the time surrounding the January 5th run-off election in Georgia is of particular interest.
The minimum target on a breakout is $2300 for this leg higher.
