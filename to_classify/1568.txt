 Rhodium prices: herePrices have risen by 3000% in five years and just 1.5 kilograms of rhodium now costs almost $1 million.
Sales in China, the biggest market, are forecast to grow this year after only a slight dip in 2020, and emissions regulations tighten again in 2023.
The COVID-19 pandemic, meanwhile, tightened the market, with lockdowns and outbreaks disrupting mining and transport in South Africa, the top producer.
This, along with outages at processing facilities run by Anglo American Platinum (Amplats), reduced total rhodium supply by 16% last year, said Wilma Swarts at specialist consultancy Metals Focus.
Amplats has repaired its operations, but rising coronavirus cases in South Africa threaten further supply disruption, said Heraeus, a major producer and trader.
