 Gold markets have shown a bit of resiliency near the 50 day EMA during the Wednesday session, as we have formed a bit of gap just below there as well.
By doing so, it suggests that the market is going to continue to go towards the $1900 level and beyond.
At the end of the day, we have tested the 200 day EMA underneath and bounced significantly from it, suggesting that the longer-term trend is very much intact.
When I see this market pullback, I look to get involved on short-term pullbacks, in small bits and pieces along the way.
I do want to build a large position, but obviously you do not do that all in one shot.
