 Drugmakers have already raised list prices on more than 500 drugs in the US in the first days of 2021, researchers say.
Dozens of pharmaceutical firms including Pfizer, Abbvie, AstraZeneca and Bristol Myers Squibb started imposing the hikes on Jan. 1, according to data compiled by health care research firm 46brooklyn.
Among the increases was a 7.4 percent jump for Humira, Abbvie’s rheumatoid arthritis treatment that holds the title of the world’s best-selling drug.
The increases come at a time when drugmakers are grappling with reduced demand for some drugs as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to a drop in doctor visits.
The 46brooklyn dataset only reflects changes in the list prices of drugs and doesn’t “capture the variable, completely hidden, and ever-growing rebates shuffling around in the dark,” the firm said on its website.
