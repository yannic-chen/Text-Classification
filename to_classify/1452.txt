 After Monday’s big rally in gold and silver, they have confirmed the breakouts and should continue to run higher.
Platinum was the weakest of the group on Monday but held support and should join the party with Gold and Silver in moving higher.
Based on Monday’s huge rally, expect Gold and Silver to consolidate for a few days possibly trade lower.
As of today, we are long Gold, Silver and Platinum.
Our expectations for now are April Gold should see $2,000, Mach Silver $29 and April Platinum $1,200.
