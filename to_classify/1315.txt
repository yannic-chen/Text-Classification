 Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesA seven-day trading period known as the "Santa Claus rally" is set to take hold of Wall Street and could push the stock market higher into year-end, according to LPL's Ryan Detrick.
And if a Santa Claus rally fails to materialize, it could serve as a warning sign that further market weakness is in store for the start of next year.
A "Santa Claus rally" is set to take hold of Wall Street as investors look for a strong finish in the stock market, according to a note from LPL chief market strategist Ryan Detrick.
According to Detrick, the period marks the strongest seven-day period in which stocks are reliably higher, and aids December in being the best performing month of the year for the stock market.
Over the past 20 years, the five times stocks posted negative returns during the Santa Claus rally period, the month of January was lower for stocks each time.
