 Daily Swing Chart Technical Forecast

The direction of the gold market into the close on Thursday will be determined by trader reaction to the short-term Fibonacci level at $1894.60.

Bullish Scenario

A sustained move over $1894.60 will indicate the presence of buyers. Overtaking the minor top at $1904.30 could trigger an acceleration to the upside with $1973.30 the next major upside target.

Bearish Scenario

A sustained move under $1894.60 will signal the presence of sellers. This could trigger a pullback into the 50% level at $1870.30. If it fails then look for the selling to possibly extend into $1861.00. This is the last potential support before the $1820.00 main bottom.

Side Notes

Trader reaction to $1870.30 to $1894.60 will determine the near-term direction of the gold market. Counter-trend sellers are going to try to stop the rally in order to form a secondary lower top, while aggressive trend-traders are going to try to drive the market into $1973.30.
