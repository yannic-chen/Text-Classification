Gold on Monday bounced off a six-week trough as a rally in equities stalled, though gains were capped by a stronger dollar and higher U.S. Treasury yields.
Spot gold was up 0.1% at $1,849.64 per ounce, after touching its lowest since Dec. 2 at $1,816.53.
Silver fell 0.9% to $25.15 an ounce, having earlier fallen to a near one-month low of $24.30.
It has built a solid support area around $1,830 and there is a good chance of gold recovering to $1,880 or $1,900," ActivTrades' De Casa said.
