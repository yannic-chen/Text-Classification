 Nonetheless, if you’re going to trade then be prepared for the possibility of heightened volatility since many of the major players will be on the sidelines.

Trump Signs Pandemic Relief and Government Funding Bill

Trump’s signing of the bill has fueled a major reaction in the financial markets with U.S. stock index futures and gold rallying, and the U.S. Dollar and 10-year Treasury Notes moving lower. The bill which totaled about $2.3 trillion in pandemic aid contains a spending package, restores unemployment benefits to millions of Americans and averts a federal government shutdown in a crisis of his own making.

Reuters is reporting that Trump, who leaves office on January 20 after losing November’s election to President-elect Joe Biden, backed down from his threat to block the bill, which was approved by Congress last week, after he came under intense pressure from lawmakers on both sides.

The Republican president, who golfed on Sunday and remained out of public view even as the potential government crisis loomed, had demanded that Congress change the bill to increase the size of stimulus checks for struggling Americans to $2,000 from $600.

It was not immediately clear why Trump changed his mind as his resistance to the massive legislative package promised a chaotic final stretch of his presidency, according to Reuters.

White House officials have been tight-lipped about Trump’s thinking but a source familiar with the situation said some advisers had urged him to relent because they did not see the point of refusing.

“Good news on COVID Relief Bill. Information to follow!” Trump said in a cryptic message on Twitter earlier on Sunday evening but he offered no explanation.
