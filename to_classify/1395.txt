 Making The Bitcoin BetThe Bitcoin bet has two components:Bitcoin is a store of value Bitcoin is an asymmetric betThe store-of-value component is by design and it isn’t going away.
Consider the facts that:The Bitcoin market with 1 BTC valued at $20,000 would be as large as JPMorgan’s total market valuation.
The Bitcoin market with 1 BTC valued at $50,000 would be as large as Google’s total market valuation.
The Bitcoin market with 1 BTC valued at $100,000 would be as large as Apple’s total market valuation.
For it just to reach the same size as the gold market, Bitcoin will have to grow by 30 times.
