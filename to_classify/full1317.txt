 Gold futures were trading little changed on Thursday, ahead of the Christmas holiday.

Traders of precious metals have been watching the path of a U.S. coronavirus fiscal aid package, passed by Congress on Monday but which is currently unsigned on President Donald Trump’s desk.

“The marketplace remains tentative on this last trading day of the holiday-shortened week,” wrote Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco.com, in a daily research note.

“President Trump unexpectedly vetoed a big U.S. defense spending bill on Wednesday and has held up a financial stimulus package for Americans that Congress had passed earlier this week,” he wrote.

Bullish gold traders have pinned expectations for higher prices on the passage of an aid package that is seen bolstering appetite for bullion as a hedge against governments attempt to tackle COVID-19 problems with increased spending.
