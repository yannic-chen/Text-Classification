 Implications for Gold in 2021What does the difference in the Fed’s stance imply for the price of gold in 2021?
Well, on one hand, because the Fed acted aggressively, there is less room for further monetary policy easing .
This is my biggest worry for the gold market in 2021: that monetary policy has already become so dovish, that now it can be only hawkish – at least on a relative basis.
The Fed has a clear dovish bias, so the interest rates may go down further – after all, given the debt trap , the central banks could be forced to cap the bond yields , which should support gold prices.
