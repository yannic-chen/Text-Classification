 I’ve already analyzed it in last Thursday’s (Dec. 17) edition of the Fundamental Gold Report , but then I focused on the monetary policy statement and the fresh dot-plot .
The Fed Chair sounded dovish, as he emphasized the U.S. central bank’s commitment to maintaining its very accommodative stance.
In particular, Powell reiterated that the Fed will not hike interest rates or reduce its asset purchase program anytime soon.
Higher inflation with the nominal interest rates unchanged imply lower real interest rates – further declines in these rates should push the gold prices up .
Moreover, Powell will announce in advance when he wants to take his foot off the gas pedal and start reducing the amount of monetary accommodation.
