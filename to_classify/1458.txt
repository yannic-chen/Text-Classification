Gold prices edged lower on Thursday as firmer Treasury yields eclipsed support from a Democrat sweep in Georgia Senate runoffs that boosted hopes for more stimulus.
Spot gold eased 0.3% to $1,912.90 per ounce, after declining more than 1.5% in the previous session.
"The rise of 10-year bond yields after the Senate victory by Democrats in Georgia has pushed gold lower, because it's extremely sensitive to the trajectory of yields," said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA.
Many investors view bullion as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement that they fear could result from large stimulus measures.
