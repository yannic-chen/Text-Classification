 Gold markets have gone back and forth during the course of the trading session on Tuesday as we are struggling just below the $1950 level.
If we can break above the top of the $1950 level, then the market looks likely to go looking towards the $2000 level.
The $2000 level of course is a large, round, psychologically significant figure but at this point in time I do think that we will eventually slice through there as well.

I would be more than willing to start buying as I do believe that the longer-term move in the gold market will continue to go to the upside.
