 Kitco News has launched its 2021 Outlook, which offers the most comprehensive coverage of precious metals markets in the new year.
(Kitco News) - When something goes straight up, it usually comes straight back down said Chris Vermeulen, chief market strategist at The Technical Traders, referring to bitcoin's recent parabolic move upwards.
“Typically when [you have] a multi-year base, typically you’re going to see two to three times that rally to the upside.
The more something goes straight up, the more likely it is to come straight back down,” Vermeulen said.
“Even if you’re a precious metals holder, you pretty much still want to be in line with the broad market because it’ll pull metals and miners up and down with it,” he said.
