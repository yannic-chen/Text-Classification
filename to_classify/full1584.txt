 Gains Capped by Firm Benchmark Yields

Despite the market being underpinned by COVID concerns, buyers are not chasing gold higher because benchmark 10-year Treasury yields remain close to 10-month highs reached earlier in the week. This is helping to support the U.S. Dollar, which is dampening foreign demand for dollar-denominated gold.

Fed’s Powell Provides Some Support for Gold

The gold market found some support from comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman on Thursday after he suggested no change in interest rates. U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said an interest rate hike would not be coming anytime soon and pushed back against suggestions that it might taper bond purchases.

Daily Forecast

Gold prices are consolidating because the fundamentals are mixed. In other words, there are no strong catalysts to push prices in either direction at this time. The chart pattern suggests volatility may be just around the corner, however.

In order to get gold prices moving to the upside it’s going to need help from Treasury yields and the U.S. Dollar. Yields are going to have to start declining and the dollar is going to have to resume its downtrend.

We may not get a clear signal on either until the Fed meets at the end of the month. Therefore, a prolonged sideways trade is a strong possibility.
