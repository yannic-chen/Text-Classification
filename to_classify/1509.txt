 Dado Ruvic/ReutersBitcoin hit a new all-time high of more than $41,000, as the cryptocurrency rally showed little sign of slowing down despite recent volatility.
Critics question whether the rally is sustainable and point to past crashes in Bitcoin such as when it dropped from $19,000 to $4,000 between 2017 and 2019.
Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of more than $41,000 on Friday morning, staging a rapid recovery despite falling to less than $37,000 overnight.
Bitcoin has more than doubled in value over the last month, and risen over 30% in 2021 so far.
Rival cryptocurrency Ethereum was up 6.26% over the last 24 hours to $1,269.47 on Friday morning, according to Coinbase data.
