 (Kitco News) Kitco's silver survey results are in, and the average response to "where do you see silver prices at the end of 2021" was $38 an ounce, while the most popular response was $50 an ounce.
The second-most-popular range was between $40 and $50 an ounce by the year-end, with a total of 682 votes, or 39%.
And a tiny minority of 41, or 2%, votes saw silver below $20 an ounce by the end of 2021.
New record highs for the silver market would be a breach of the $50 an ounce level.
