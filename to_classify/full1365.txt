 Technical analysis

Gold prices moved higher but continue to trade in a tight range. Support is near the 10-day moving average near 1,872, with resistance seen near the December highs at 1,906. The 10-day moving average crossed above the 50-day moving average which means a medium-term uptrend is now in place. Short-term momentum has turned positive as the fast stochastic generated a crossover buy signal.. Medium-term momentum is positive to neutral as the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram prints in the black with a flattening trajectory, which points to consolidation.
