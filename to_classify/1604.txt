 Silver is expected to perform better than gold for the near to medium-term, and Americas Gold and Silver’s production strategy will evolve around this thesis, said CEO Darren Blasutti.
“I think silver is going to outperform gold this year and for the next couple of years.
I’m bullish on gold too by the way, but we’ve had a really nice run on gold, I think there’s still a ways to go on silver.
Blasutti’s comments come as America’s Gold and Silver’s Relief Canyon mine entered commercial production this month, a project that will significantly increase production and free cash flow.
“It’s going to generate this year, roughly 60,000 ounces of gold,” Blasutti said.
