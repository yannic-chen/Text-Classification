 (Kitco News) - Gold and silver futures prices are higher in early U.S. trading and have made strong recoveries after both markets hit multi-week lows overnight.
The big rebounds suggest the bears are near-term exhausted and that today’s lows could be near-term market bottoms.
February gold futures were last up $7.40 at $1,837.20 and March Comex silver was last up $0.399 at $25.265 an ounce.
Traders and investors are more upbeat to start the U.S. trading week, following the three-day holiday weekend.
Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the November low of $1,767.20.
