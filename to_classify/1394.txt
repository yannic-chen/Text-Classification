 Gold markets have gapped higher to kick off the trading session on Thursday, pulled back to fill the gap, and then turned around to form a hammer.
That is a very bullish sign, and we are trying to break out above the $1900 level yet again.
This pressure does suggest that we are eventually going to make that happen and go looking towards the $1950 level above.
This sets up for gold to rally, and therefore I think it is only a matter of time before we do just that.
In fact, it is not until we break down below the $1800 level that I am concerned about gold, and I think that is not going to happen anytime soon.
