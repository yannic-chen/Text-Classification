 Gains Capped by Firm Benchmark YieldsDespite the market being underpinned by COVID concerns, buyers are not chasing gold higher because benchmark 10-year Treasury yields remain close to 10-month highs reached earlier in the week.
This is helping to support the U.S. Dollar, which is dampening foreign demand for dollar-denominated gold.
In order to get gold prices moving to the upside it’s going to need help from Treasury yields and the U.S. Dollar.
Yields are going to have to start declining and the dollar is going to have to resume its downtrend.
We may not get a clear signal on either until the Fed meets at the end of the month.
