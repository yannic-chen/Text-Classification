 TOKYO -- Money is flowing into the markets for such materials as copper, silver and aluminum on growing demand thanks to a shift to renewable energy and electric cars.
Furthermore, copper is essential in infrastructure for boosting the use of renewable energy.
"Similar investment money is starting to flow into commodities markets."
The inflow into commodities markets can partly be explained by investors looking for somewhere to put money whose supply has grown as monetary policy is loosened to deal with the coronavirus.
Whether demand for green commodities really grows is yet to be seen, but investors seem to have sensed a new trend.
