 (Kitco News) Gold climbed up from daily lows after private-payrolls processor ADP reported a decrease in jobs in December instead of expected growth.
Private payrolls declined 123,000 during the previous month, which marked the first decrease since April, ADP said on Wednesday.
In an initial reaction to the data, gold ticked up from daily lows but remained in negative territory.
Small companies that employ up to 50 people were in the second spot with 13,000 jobs lost.
The majority of payrolls lost were in the service-providing sector, which saw a decrease of 105,000 jobs in December.
