 Profit-taking hits oil pricesOil prices beat a modest retreat overnight with official US Crude Inventory data broadly neutral.
Brent crude eased 1.25% to USD56.00 a barrel, and WTI fell 0.80% to USD52.85 a barrel.
With gas prices still at record highs in Asia, oil is unlikely to retreat far in today’s session.
That was enough to send gold 0.45% lower to USD1845.00 an ounce overnight.
It is an ominous development for gold that it fell overnight, even as the key US 10-year yield also eased lower.
