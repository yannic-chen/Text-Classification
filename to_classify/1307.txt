 After finding support near the $22 per ounce level late last month, silver rallied more than 20% throughout December to reach over $27.50, before pulling back to the $25 area on Tuesday.
According to Christopher Lewis of fxempire.com, there could be significant support for silver as it potentially makes its way above the $30 per ounce level.
“The market has recently broken out of a four dollar range, and therefore it would extrapolate towards a move near the $32 level.
Such thin volume frequently generates dramatic swings in both directions, as there are no major players to stabilize the market.
Lewis noted that “The market does seem to have support underneath, especially near the $26 level and the 50 day EMA which sits right around the $24.50 level.
