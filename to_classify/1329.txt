 REUTERS/Stephen LamBitcoin's market cap could hit a trillion dollars as early as 2021, according to Blockchain.com's head of research.
Although the 2020 bitcoin rally was largely driven by institutional investors, he expects to see continued buy-in more from retail and Wall Street investors going forward.
Bitcoin's market cap could reach $1 trillion sometime in 2021 as investors take its reserve currency status more seriously, according to Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain.com.
Bitcoin has a current market cap of about $350 billion, while that of gold's stands at roughly $10 trillion.
"My expectation is that bitcoin will become a trillion dollar asset as early as next year," the crypto researcher told Business Insider.
