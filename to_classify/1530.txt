 Technical Analysis – Gold leans to the bearish side again; 200-day SMA in focusA- A A+Gold came under severe selling pressure on Friday, slumping below a steep ascending trendline and back into the descending channel.
That said, the price needs to close clearly below the 200-day SMA and more importantly below the resistance-turned-support of 1,817 to motivate additional selling towards the 1,790 – 1,764 area.
If efforts prove successful, positive momentum may run up to the 50% Fibonacci of 1,920, while higher all attention will turn to the key 1,956 bar.
The narrowing distance between the 50- and 200-day SMAs continues to signal a trend deterioration.
In brief, gold remains exposed to downside corrections in the short term following Friday’s collapse, though for the bears to get fresh impetus they should first claim the 200-day SMA and the 1,817 number.
