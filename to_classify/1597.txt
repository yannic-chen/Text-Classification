 Gold markets initially fell during the trading session on Tuesday to break down below the 200 day EMA.
However, we have turned right back around to show signs of support, as the 200 day EMA of course attracts a certain amount of attention.
That being said, the market has also shown signs of support at the $1800 level.
That is a large, round, psychologically significant figure that has attracted attention in the past, so ultimately it is not a huge surprise to see that we have seen this happen.
Stimulus of course is at the forefront of almost everything that happens these days, which should drive up the value of gold over the longer term.
