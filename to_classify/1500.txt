 Investors should sell their long positions in stocks as the market is "wildly overvalued," AlphaOmega Advisors' Peter Cecchini said in a note on Wednesday.
Higher taxes under a Democratic controlled Congress and higher long-term interest rates under are two risks to the stock market that could be particularly troublesome for tech and small cap stocks, according to the note.
"The reflation narrative on a Democratic sweep ignores the impact of higher taxes and the potential for higher yields," Cecchini said.
Increased deposits from stimulus measures are going straight into the equity market, according to Cecchini.
"Those deposits, coupled with easy access to markets through mobile-based trading apps, have found their way directly into equity markets, and especially the most speculative stocks," Cecchini explained.
