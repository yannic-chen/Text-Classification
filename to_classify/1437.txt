 (Kitco News) - Gold and silver futures prices are lower in early U.S. trading Wednesday, on some normal profit taking from the shorter-term futures traders and some chart consolidation after gold hit a two-month high overnight and silver scored a four-month high.
Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at $1,900.00.
Silver bulls' next upside price objective is closing prices above solid technical resistance at the August 2020 high of $30.365 an ounce.
The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at $26.00.
First resistance is seen at the overnight high of $28.105 and then at $28.50.
