 Daily Swing Chart Technical Analysis

The main trend is down according to the daily swing chart, but momentum may be getting ready to shift to the upside with the formation of a closing price reversal bottom on Tuesday.

A trade through $1962.50 will change the main trend to up. This is highly unlikely, but a change in the minor trend is possible. A move through $1800.80 will signal a resumption of the downtrend.

The minor trend is down. A trade through $1864.00 will change the minor trend to up. This will also shift momentum to the upside.

The main support is a long-term retracement zone at $1780.50 to $1705.20. This area stopped the selling on November 30 at $1767.20.

The short-term range is $1767.20 to $1962.50. Its 50% level at $1864.90 is the first upside target.

The minor range is $1962.50 to $1800.80. Its 50% level at $1881.70 is another potential upside target. Since the main trend is down, sellers could come in on a test of this level.
