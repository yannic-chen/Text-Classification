 In a note published Monday, JPMorgan made a bold long-term price target for bitcoin, claiming the red-hot cryptocurrency could rally as high as $146,000 as it competes with gold as an "alternative" currency.
Bitcoin's market cap — calculated by multiplying the price by the total number of coins in circulation — currently stands at over $575 billion.
According to JPMorgan, it would have to climb by 4.6 times to match the $2.7 trillion of private sector gold investment.
For bitcoin's market value to reach that level, its price volatility would need to drop substantially to give institutional investors the confidence required to make large bets.
Still, JPMorgan says there's "little doubt that the institutional flow impulse into bitcoin is what distinguishes 2020 from 2017."
