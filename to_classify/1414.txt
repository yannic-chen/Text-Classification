 In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Lee said bitcoin could quadruple in 2021 as the crypto asset experiences a similar parabolic setup that occurred in 2017.
"2021 is going to be a lot like 2017 which means bitcoin should do even better in 2021 than it did in 2020, so something above 300%," Lee told CNBC.
Following a strong 2020 that saw bitcoin march to all time highs for a gain of around 300%, 2021 could be even stronger.
At its current price of about $29,000, a quadruple in bitcoin would put the crypto asset well above the $100,000 mark at $116,000.
Fundstrat's digital asset strategist David Grider also raised his outlook for bitcoin in a note on Wednesday, expecting the crypto asset to hit at least $40,000 next year.
