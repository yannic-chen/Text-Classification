 Futures for gold were bouncing around on Monday as global stocks retrench and bitcoin, the biggest recent rival to gold, suffered a price correction after a massive rally above $40,000.
A recently buoyant dollar may be capping upside moves for metals on the day.
The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.61% , a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.5%.
A firmer dollar was likely to limit the ascent for gold and silver prices, dealers said, because a stronger dollar can make assets priced in the currency comparatively more expensive to overseas buyers.
Trading in precious metals on Monday comes after gold lost nearly 3.2% for the week, while silver saw a weekly slide of 6.7%.
