 Gold markets have had a little bit of a rough week, as traders continue to determine whether or not there is going to be a significant stimulus package coming out the United States.
Ultimately, there will be but there has been some questioning of the size of the stimulus package, perhaps not as big as the $1.9 trillion that Joe Biden is hoping to achieve.
If that is going to be the case, then it makes quite a bit of sense that the market is still kind of treading water in general, trying to figure out what to do next.
At this point, I would wait for some type of supportive candlestick in order to get involved, and then start aiming for the highs again.
I do believe that this is what gold will do over the next year or so.
