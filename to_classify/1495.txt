 The total market value of all cryptocurrencies rose above $1 trillion for the first time on Thursday as Bitcoin surged to a record high.
The market cap of all cryptocurrencies rose 10 percent to $1.042 trillion on Thursday, data from CoinMarketCap shows.
Bitcoin accounts for around 69 percent of the total market cap of the total.
Ethereum, which tends to trade in tandem with Bitcoin, also on Thursday hit its highest level since January 2018, touching $1,287.69.
JPM strategists said the upside is conditional on the volatility of bitcoin converging with that of gold in the longer term.
