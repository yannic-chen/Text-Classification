 Consider the chart below, which plots gold’s GC00, +0.30% trailing five-year inflation-adjusted return (in U.S. dollars relative to the U.S. Consumer Price Index).
But that doesn’t make the stock market a good inflation hedge over any five-year period.
For comparison, consider that gold’s average five-year inflation-adjusted return since the mid-1970s is 2.2% annualized.
So in terms of simple averages, stocks are a better inflation hedge than gold.
Since the mid-1970s, stocks’ five-year inflation-adjusted return has been as high as 25.7% annualized and as low as minus 8.1% annualized.
