"We believe that the valuation and position backdrop has become a lot more challenging for bitcoin at the beginning of the New Year," JPMorgan said.
Bitcoin's 300% surge in 2020 could repeat this year, but such a move higher would be unsustainable, JPMorgan said in a note on Monday.
JPMorgan still sees bitcoin competing against gold as an "alternative" currency, with millennial investors preferring the "digital gold" over traditional gold and driving demand for the cryptocurrency.
A convergence in volatilities between bitcoin and gold is unlikely to happen quickly and is in our mind a multi-year process," JPMorgan said.
