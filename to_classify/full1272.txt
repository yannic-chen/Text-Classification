(Kitco News) - Gold price are holding on to strong gains but is seeing little reaction to falling momentum in the U.S. labor market as more workers apply for first-time unemployment benefits.

Thursday the U.S. Labor Department said that weekly jobless claims rose by 23,000 to 885,000, up from the previous week’s revised estimate of 853,000 claims.

The latest labor market data missed economists’ estimates as consensus forecasts called for initial claims to be round 817,000.

The gold market is seeing little reaction to the latest economic report as it continues to see strong buying after Wednesday’s Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting. The central bank signaled that it would maintain its extremely accommodative monetary policies for foreseeable future. February gold futures last traded at $1,886.30 an ounce, up 1.46% on the day.

The four-week moving average for new claims – often viewed as a more reliable measure of the labor market since it flattens week-to-week volatility – rose 812,500, an increase of 34,250 claims from the previous week.



Continuing jobless claims, which represent the number of people already receiving benefits, were at 5.508 million during the week ending Dec. 5, down by 273,000 from the previous week.
