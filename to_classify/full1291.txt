(Kitco News) - Gold and silver futures prices modestly lower in early U.S. trading Tuesday. Global stock markets have stabilized Tuesday after hitting some fresh Covid turbulence on Monday, and that is keeping buyers of the safe-haven metals tentative so far today. February gold futures were last down $3.80 at $1,879.00 and March Comex silver was last down $0.329 at $26.05 an ounce.

Global stock markets were mixed overnight, with Asian shares mostly down and European shares mostly firmer. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward slightly higher openings when the New York day session begins. The global marketplace is still a bit edgy following the weekend news of a newly discovered and more easily transmissible strain of Covid-19 in the U.K. Several countries have banned travel to and from Britain. Some health experts said they believe the current Covid vaccines could be effective on the new mutation of the virus. However, it’s too soon to tell if the current Covid vaccines will be as effective on the new strain as on the original form of the virus. The bottom line for the marketplace is keener uncertainty that leads to risk aversion.

Reports overnight said the U.K. and the European Union may be getting closer on reaching a smooth Brexit agreement.

The U.S. dollar index is higher in early U.S. trading on a corrective rebound after hitting a 2.5-year low last week. The other important outside market sees February Nymex crude oil futures prices lower and trading around $47.50 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures is currently trading around 0.938%.
