 As the year winds down, gold, silver and platinum remain in uptrends but have found the torture of consolidation.
There is virtually no doubt that gold, silver and platinum will be in uptrends as 2021 kicks off.
Platinum is the strongest, followed by silver.
Because of its overall thin volume and lack of real liquidity, platinum is the most likely to break out to the upside first.
Silver is a strong second place to platinum, but looks destined for the biggest percentage gains in 2021.
