 (Kitco News) - A weaker U.S. dollar due to the global economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic won't be enough to support gold prices, according to one French Bank.
He said that improving economic activity will push yields higher, increasing the precious metal's opportunity costs.
Looking at 2021, Natixis is neutral on the precious metal as it sees gold prices averaging the year around $1,838 an ounce.
"Gold prices will retreat as the economy normalizes and investors see the positive impact of the COVID vaccine," he said.
Although Natixis is neutral on gold, Dhadah said that he is not expecting to see a collapse in the market.
