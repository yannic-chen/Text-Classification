 A weaker-than-expected December jobs report failed to provide much of lift for metals on the session.
Investors also will watch for a report on the health of the U.S. jobs market, which could influence trade in precious metals.
Silver for March delivery SIH21, -2.52% SI00, -2.52% , meanwhile, was trading 68 cents, or 2.5%, lower at $$26.58 an ounce.
For the week, gold was on track for a weekly skid of 0.3%, while silver was set for a weekly slide of less than 0.1%, based on the most-active contracts.
Market participants said that the lack of upside reaction from gold may be due to expectations that the jobs report would be softer and a bullish economic outlook that could hurt gold prices in the near term.
