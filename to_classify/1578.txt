 Stan Honda/AFP/Getty ImagesUBS's Mark Haefele said in a Friday note that while cryptocurrencies and SPACs show signs of "irrational exuberance," investors shouldn't worry that the whole stock market is in a bubble.
Within the IPO and SPAC market and cryptocurrencies, prices are discounting future rapid price appreciation, a factor that's typically present during market bubbles, said Haefele.
But large parts of the stock market are not expensively valued by historical comparison, the chief investment officer of global wealth management said.
While many parts of the market are showing signs of "irrational exuberance" that should alarm some investors, UBS's Mark Haefele says there are still some risk assets outside of bubble territory.
However, Haefele said that while parts of the market seem speculative, investors shouldn't worry that the whole market is in a bubble.
