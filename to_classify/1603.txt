 43-101, was in hole 88-33, which intersected 18.7 m grading 0.30 g/t gold, 4.31 g/t silver, 0.15 % copper and 1.18 % zinc.
Hole LME20-030 was a twin of historic hole 88-33 and hole LME20-031 was designed as a follow-up to further test mineralization down dip.
Re-assay data results for selected samples from hole LME20-031 is presented in Table 2.
Azimuth: 145°, Dip: -45°, Depth: 176 m LME20-031: 446126 mE, 5512535 mN, 327 m ASL.
The discrepancy in high grade gold values between samples is attributed to different material from sample selection and fluctuating (nuggety) gold mineralization.
