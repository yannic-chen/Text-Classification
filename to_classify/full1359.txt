(Kitco News) - Gold futures prices are modestly up in early U.S. trading Monday, boosted a bit by a weaker U.S. dollar index that is hovering near a 2.5-year low. Gains in the yellow metal are being limited by higher U.S. and global equity markets. Silver prices are posting solid gains to start the trading week. February gold futures were last up $3.10 at $1,886.40 and March Comex silver was last up $0.787 at $26.695 an ounce.

Global stock markets were mostly up overnight. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward higher openings and new record highs for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes when the New York day session begins. The marketplace has been buoyed by President Trump in a surprise move over the weekend signing the Covid-19 aid bill that the U.S. Congress agreed upon just before Christmas. The bill provides direct payments to Americans and also loans to U.S. businesses.

Traders and investors are also more upbeat as Covid vaccines continued to be rolled out in the U.S. and Europe. Still the enthusiasm is tempered by the pandemic that continues to be out of control in the U.S., Europe and other parts of the world. Some health experts are saying January will be the worst month yet, as far as the human toll. Restrictions on many businesses in many locations remain in place and may get tighter in January.

The U.S. dollar index is slightly lower in early U.S. trading. The other important outside market sees February Nymex crude oil futures prices firmer and trading around $48.50 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures is currently around 0.956%.

U.S. economic data due for release Monday is light and includes the Texas manufacturing outlook survey.

Technically, the February gold futures bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage amid a price uptrend still in place on the daily bar chart. However, bulls need to show fresh power soon to keep the uptrend alive. Bulls’ next upside price objective is to produce a close in February futures above solid resistance at the November high of $1,973.30. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at $1,820.00. First resistance is seen at $1,900.00 and then at the December high of $1,912.00. First support is seen at the overnight low of $1,873.00 and then at last week’s low of 1,859.00. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.0.

March silver futures bulls have the firm overall near-term technical advantage amid a near-term price uptrend in place on the daily chart.

The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at $25.00. First resistance is seen at the overnight high of $26.98 and then at $27.50.
