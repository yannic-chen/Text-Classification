 (Kitco News) The new year will trigger new highs for gold, according to Standard Chartered, which sees the majority of gains in the first half of 2021.
"We maintain a positive view on gold; expect prices to retest USD 2,000/oz threshold and reach new highs," Standard Chartered precious metals analyst Suki Cooper said on Friday.
"We believe the bulk of gold gains are likely to materialize in the first half of the year."
The biggest risks for gold in 2021 are sudden QE tapering and a quick vaccine rollout, the report highlighted.
"Key risks stem from earlier-than-anticipated QE tapering and faster-than-expected vaccine rollout, which would boost economic and social confidence," Cooper noted.
