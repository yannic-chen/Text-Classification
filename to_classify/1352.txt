 Collectors continue to love big, flashy, gold coins, and the economic uncertainty over the past year has made gold coins from around the world a desired asset.
Heritage’s Nov. 5 World and Ancient Coins Platinum Night auction realized more than $8.5 million.
Leading the bidding was an 1826 George IV gold £5 coin graded Proof 66 Ultra Cameo by Numismatic Guaranty Corp. that sold for $360,000.
Only 150 examples were produced, featuring the masterful engraving of William Wyon.
The coin was produced as part of a Proof set where the artist idealized the sitter’s features, as so often seen in Royal portraiture.
