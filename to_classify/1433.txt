 Hathaway explained that many investors are waiting to see if mining companies have learned their lessons from the last bull market.
Although gold prices rallied to record highs in 2011, mining companies reported terrible margins as they overleveraged their balance sheets.
Hathaway also said that some investors are worried that gold prices could be nearing a top around $2,000 an ounce.
However, he said that he thinks this is only the start of a larger bull market in the precious metal.
Ultimately, it's the price of gold that will eventually bring investors to the mining sector, Hathaway said, reiterating his stance that gold is in a new long-term bull market.
