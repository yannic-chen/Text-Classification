 Gold markets have rallied just a bit during the trading session on Tuesday, as we continue to see markets kill time as we head into the new year.
Underneath, the 50 day EMA offers support as we have seen over the last several days.
We had recently reached down towards the $1800 level, bouncing from the 200 day EMA as well.
This is typical for a major pull back, and now it looks like we are ready to continue the longer-term uptrend.
Longer-term, I think we go even further than that, so given enough time I do think that gold into being a longer-term “buy-and-hold” type of scenario.
