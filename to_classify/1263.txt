 (Kitco News) The crypto world is on fire, with bitcoin breaching $20,000 for the very first time on Wednesday and hitting new all-time highs.
At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at $20,672, up 6.23% on the day.
Analysts remain very optimistic on bitcoin's future price action, saying that this rally is different from the one back in 2017 when bitcoin first approached $20,000.
This time around, institutional investors are getting involved, while IPOS defined 2017, said Digix co-founder and COO Shaun Djie told Kitco News.
One of the biggest risks next year is inflation, and institutional investors have started to embrace bitcoin as protection against that.
