(Kitco News) - The gold market is struggling to attract some buying momentum with prices below $1,900 even as U.S. consumer sentiment falls in December ahead of the Christmas holidays.
American consumer confidence index declined to 88.6 in December, down from November’s 92.9 the U.S. Conference Board reported Tuesday.
Gold prices remain roughly unchanged on the day seeing little reaction to the weaker than expected economic data.
February gold futures last traded at $1,880.40 an ounce.
