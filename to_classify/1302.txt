 Silver markets have been very choppy during the trading session on Tuesday as we continue to trade thin volume.
After all, it is a holiday week and therefore we have little in the way of volume.
Ultimately, I think that short-term pullbacks will probably continue to be bought into, as the market could go looking towards the $28 level eventually.
I have no interest in trying to short silver because it has such bullish pressure underneath.
Ultimately, the US Dollar Index is negatively correlated to the silver market, so if the US dollar does take a little bit of a beating, that will of course help silver rally.
