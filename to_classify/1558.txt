 Technical analysisGold prices moved sideways, consolidating, unable to gain headway, and running into resistance near the 50-day moving average near 1,867.
Support is seen near an upward sloping trend line that comes in near 1,815.
Short-term momentum has turned negative as the fast stochastic continues to accelerate lower.
Medium-term momentum has turned negative as the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) line generated a crossover sell signal.
This occurs as the MACD line (the 12-day moving average minus the 26-day moving average) crosses above the MACD signal line).
