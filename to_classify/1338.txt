 Gold markets have gapped higher to kick off the trading session on Monday, before turning around and falling towards the 50 day EMA and filling the gap.
By turning things around in the manner we have, we have slammed into the $1900 level.
If we can break above the $1900 level, then the market could go looking towards the $1950 level.
At that area, we have seen a lot of selling, as you can see by the huge red candle from that level.
