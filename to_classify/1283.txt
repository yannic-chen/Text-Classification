 (Kitco News) Gold's best days are still ahead of it, according to the TD Securities outlook, which is looking for the precious metal to keep rising throughout 2021 and 2022.
TD Securities is long gold and silver in its outlook, highlighting inflation expectations, Fed's flexible average inflation targeting, currency debasement fears, weaker U.S. dollar, and lingering economic concerns as some of the main drivers.
"Gold enthusiasts may not need to wait much longer for a convincing move higher.
This suggests that the market should see a boost in inflationary expectations, leading to a renewed downtrend in real rates and a positive outlook for gold," TD Securities commodity strategists said.
Even though all signs are pointing to $2,100 gold over the next 12 months, TD Securities advises investors that it will be a bumpy road getting there.
