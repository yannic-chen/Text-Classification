(Kitco News) - Gold and silver futures prices are moderately higher in midday trading Wednesday. A depreciating U.S. dollar on the foreign exchange market that saw the U.S. dollar index hit a new 2.5-year low today is bullish for the precious metals. However, gold and silver bulls are still being somewhat squelched by rallying U.S. and global equity markets that see the U.S. stock indexes near record highs. February gold futures were last up $7.10 at $1,890.00 and March Comex silver was last up $0.288 at $26.505 an ounce.

Global stock markets were mostly up overnight. U.S. stock indexes are higher at midday. Trader and investor risk appetite remains elevated as market participants are opting to look just over the horizon to see what will likely be strong economic recoveries under way as soon as late spring, and choosing to look beyond the Covid-19 pandemic that appears to be at its peak for infections and deaths in the U.S. and which has forced new business and public restrictions that are still hamstringing economic growth. Colorado has reported the first official U.S. case of the new strain of faster-spreading Covid that has hit the U.K.

Trading volumes are likely to start to die down at mid-week, ahead of the New Year’s Day holiday on Friday, when governments and markets are closed.
