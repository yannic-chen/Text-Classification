 (Kitco News) - The U.S. manufacturing sector is showing some resilient strength in November following stronger than expected durable goods numbers.
Wednesday, the Commerce Department said that U.S. durable-goods orders rose by 0.9% in November, up from October’s 1.8% rise.
The data were much better than expected; consensus expectations compiled by various news organizations called for durables to rise by 0.6%.
Excluding transportation, core new orders rose relatively in line with expectations, rising 0.4% last month the government said.
The gold market is not seeing much reaction to the latest manufacturing numbers.
