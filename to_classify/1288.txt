 Business development companies (BDCs) are a small but growing subset of the private credit market.
Mortgage REITs generally invest in mortgage securities and loans, and operate in other areas of the mortgage and real estate ecosystem.
Exposure to interest rate- and credit-sensitive assets in combination with leverage is what allows mortgage REITs to offer attractive yields.
The last time the Fed stepped in to this degree was in 2008, and in 2009 and 2010 mortgage REITs outperformed the S&P 500.
Yields offered by mortgage REITs have been attractive historically but also signify inherent risk.
