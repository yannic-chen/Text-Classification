 America is not headed for another Civil War, but what investors can expect is an appreciation of commodity prices in the wake of major economic changes, said E.B. Tucker, director of Metalla Royalty and author of “Why Gold, Why Now.”

“We have an opportunity with gold because what we’re going to see is that companies are going to run into some trouble when costs are rising, labor costs are rising…commodities are all going up,” Tucker said.

“If I told you [after] you woke up today from being asleep for a few years and the Capitol is on fire and people are shot and transfer payments are hitting everyone’s accounts, you would have thought, what’s the gold price? It should be much higher,” he added.

Tucker’s comments came as pro-Trump protestors broke into Capitol Building on Wednesday night, resulting in four dead and many more injured, including police officers.

“I don’t know what these people were thinking in D.C. though. I prefer anarchy from a distance. It’s kind of insane these days to go and jump barricades and scale buildings and what’s going to happen is you’re just going to turn yourself into a Wikipedia entry and I’m not sure that’s going to do anyone any favors,” he said.

On the possibility of this escalating into a full-blown civil war, Tucker said it’s unlikely.
