 Gold prices ticked higher on Wednesday as weakness in the dollar offset worries about a U.S. stimulus deal after President Donald Trump threatened not to sign the pandemic relief bill.
Spot gold rose 0.3% to $1,865.01 per ounce by 0333 GMT, while U.S. gold futures were steady at $1,869.80.
The U.S. dollar edged down 0.1% against a basket of currencies, increasing gold's appeal among holders of other units.
I think we'll see greater flows towards gold exchange-traded funds as they take some risk off the table," Langford said.
Gold will recover its historical relationship with real yields, and real yields will likely continue to fall so there is no reason to think gold cannot make another push for $2,000 next year if this trend prevails, said IG Market analyst Kyle Rodda.
