Spot gold rose 0.3% to $1,877.41 per ounce by 10:18 a.m. EST (1518 GMT).
"Supportive factors for the gold market include the weaker U.S. dollar index for the past couple of days after gains earlier this week," said Kitco Metals senior analyst Jim Wyckoff.
Risk sentiment was upbeat, while the U.S. dollar was weighed down by investors opting for sterling as Britain clinched a Brexit trade deal with the European Union.
Investors largely brushed off U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to not sign a nearly $900 billion stimulus bill.
