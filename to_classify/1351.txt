 Gold fails again near $1900 and reverses, erasing daily gains.
XAU/USD approached again during the American session the $1900 area but after reaching $1896 turned to the downside, and fell to $1875.
The DXY approached daily highs, and it was capped again at 90.30.
Both hit record highs levels.
Price is testing the $1975 support, and a consolidation below would expose the daily low at $1869 (also Thursday’s low).
