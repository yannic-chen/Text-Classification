 TD Securities blamed gold's woeful performance on higher treasury yields, greater risk appetite and recent Democrat wins.
On Friday a dramatic $66 price decline took gold prices below their 200-day moving average for the first time since December 1, 2020.
Gold should have gained support from the weak payrolls report last week, signaling a sputtering recovery, but the news was not able to stem gold's decline.
Regarding catalysts that could take gold higher, TD said to keep an "eye out for economic activity, vaccine program progress and Biden's ability to sell a new aggressive stimulus agenda as drivers of the gold market.
"We still judge that gold has a material upside, with $2,000 in the cards over the next twelve months."
