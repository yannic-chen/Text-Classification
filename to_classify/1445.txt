 (Kitco News) Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has called gold "lame" in his 2020 endnote published on Tuesday while stressing that cryptocurrencies are underrated.
Some media reports have connected Buterin's comment about gold to Euro Pacific Capital CEO Peter Schiff's latest criticism of cryptos and an argument in favor of gold.
Gold is a store of value as people buying #gold now will be able to sell it in the future to buyers who actually need to use gold as a metal.

In the meantime, gold has begun the year with an impressive rally, rising almost 3% since the start of the year.
