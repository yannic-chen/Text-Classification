Trading at $1905 for US Dollar investors – a 9-year high when reached in late-July, 2 weeks before the current all-time top of $2075 – the UK gold price in Pounds per ounce also held unchanged for the week so far at £1470.
With Ireland and Wales going back into full lockdowns as Europe faces a fast-growing second wave of the virus, longer-term interest rates ticked higher worldwide as gold prices slipped against the Euro and erased earlier gains for US and UK investors.
"Tuesday's sale," says Reuters , "is the first stage of the EU's ambitious plan to increase its debt pile 15-fold in less than a decade to fund its two coronavirus support programmes for member states, which brings [its 27 member nations] closer to debt mutualisation than ever before."
News meantime broke in the US that internet giant Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) will today receive a lawsuit from the Justice Department for "maintaining an illegal monopoly over search and search advertising."
The European Union has already challenged Google with "anti-trust" actions, fining it a total of €6.7bn, most of which the US tech giant continues to dispute.
