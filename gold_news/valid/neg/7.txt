Wholesale GOLD MARKET prices hit 1-week lows against both the US Dollar and Euro on Wednesday, falling once more as Western stock markets also fell in the face of longer-term interest rates rising as bond markets sold off across European and the US.
Back in the bullion market, giant gold-backed ETF the GLD shrank a little on Tuesday as investors liquidated shares in the trust fund overall.
That left the GLD almost unchanged in size from 8 weeks ago, when gold bullion peaked at $2075 per ounce on 6 August.
Over the 8 weeks leading up to that peak, the GLD grew by 12.6% as gold prices rose from a dip below $1700.
The metal fell less and recovered better than gold in London's bullion market on Wednesday, holding unchanged for the week so far at $23.68 per ounce.
