(Kitco News) A rally in the stock market does not mean investors have forgotten their fear, which is why "gold's story is not over yet," according to a report by RBC Capital Markets.
"After a precipitous vaccine news-driven decline, gold's current price levels still leave unanswered questions," RBC's commodity strategists wrote last week.
"Despite seemingly buoyant markets, we do not think that investors have forgotten their fear; thus gold's story is not yet over amid ongoing the economic, financial and political uncertainty.
But this reset does not mean gold's moves higher are over, they added.
While perhaps a near-term overcorrection, this reset may have helped gold find a new equilibrium," the strategists wrote.
