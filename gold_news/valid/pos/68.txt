(Kitco News) - After a rocky start, the gold market is heading into the weekend on a strong note, trading near a two-week high and with the prospect of more U.S. election turmoil.
Market analysts and retail investors see the potential for higher prices next week, according to the latest Kitco News Weekly gold Survey.
Although sentiment among retail voters remains bullish, interest in the precious metal as prices continue to consolidate has dropped significantly.
Although analysts see room for gold to move higher in the near-term, they are not convinced that prices will break above $2,000 anytime soon.
Richard Baker, editor of the Eureka Miner's Report, said that he sees gold prices modestly higher next week, but also warned that volatility will remain high.
