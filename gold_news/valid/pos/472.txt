(Kitco News) Gold was up 1% gain as U.S. Election Day was well underway on Tuesday with weaker U.S. dollar and higher stocks helping the precious metal get above $1,900 an ounce.
December Comex gold futures were last at $1,911.20, up 0.99% on the day after reaching a daily high of $1,910 an ounce.
In the meantime, the U.S. dollar index was at 94.03, up 0.16% on the day and the Dow was up nearly 600 points.
On top of the regular election jitters, markets are not certain the election results will be announced Wednesday morning.
Whether or not gold can benefit from this will depend on the U.S. dollar, Fritsch added.
