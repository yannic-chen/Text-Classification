(Kitco News) - The silver market has seen some spectacular volatility this year as market expectations shift back and forth between deflation and inflation risks.
Schieven said that she is bullish on silver for the same reason she is bullish on gold: falling real interest rates.
"I think the real interest rates, the tips yields have to go back down," she said.
She noted that the Federal Reserve expects to hold interest rates at the zero-bound range through 2023; meanwhile, the central bank also sees interest rates tick higher.
She added that silver prices could hit all-time highs in the next two to three years.
