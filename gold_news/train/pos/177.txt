Bearish ScenarioA sustained move under $1912.20 will indicate the presence of sellers.
The latter is a potential trigger point for an acceleration into a potential support cluster at $1851.00 to $1842.60.
Bullish ScenarioA sustained move over $1912.20 will signal the presence of buyers.
If this generates enough upside momentum then look for buyers to take a shot at $1939.40.
This is a potential trigger point for an acceleration to the upside with $1970.10 the primary upside target.
