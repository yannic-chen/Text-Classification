GOLD BARS traded in London – heart of the precious metal's wholesale and investment market – rose back above $1900 per ounce on Wednesday as global interest rates ticked lower, commodity prices rose, and stock markets retreated again from the last week's near-record levels.
Gold bars traded in Shanghai – the only legal entry-point for bullion into private circulation into China, the metal's largest consumer market since 2013 – meantime held today at a discount to London prices equal to $37 per ounce.
Like wholesale gold bar prices, silver bullion rose Wednesday to recover half this week's earlier plunge, trading back at $24.50 per ounce after dipping through $24 early yesterday.
Copper prices also rose Wednesday, gaining 0.5% and approaching last month's 2-year highs – up 45% from March's Covid Crash low – as a strike loomed over wages at Chile's giant Escondida mine, and rumors from Beijing sources said China will spend $900bn by 2026 on its copper-intensive power grid.
"China's next five-year plan beginning in 2021," says Bloomberg today, again quoting un-named officials , "will [also] call for increases to its mammoth state reserves of crude, strategic metals and farm goods."
