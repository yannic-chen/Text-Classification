(Kitco News) - Gold and silver futures prices are moderately higher in early U.S. trading Monday, on some more safe-haven demand just one day before the U.S. elections and all of the uncertainty and anxiousness surrounding them.
December gold futures were last up $9.40 at $1,889.30 and December Comex silver was last up $0.429 at $24.075 an ounce.
China’s “official” manufacturing PMI, which is a more complete survey, showed a reading of 51.4 in October versus 51.5 in September.
U.S. economic data due for release Monday includes the U.S. manufacturing PMI, the ISM report on business and manufacturing, construction spending, and the global manufacturing PMI.
Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the September low of $1,851.00.
