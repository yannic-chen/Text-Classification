(Kitco News) - The gold market is holding on to gains but is seeing little reaction to significantly better-than-expected sentiment in the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the latest data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM).
Monday, the ISM said its manufacturing index showed a reading of 59.3% for October, up from September’s reading of 55.4% and beating expectations.
According to some economists and analysts, the strong recovery in the manufacturing sector bodes well for future economic growth.
“This is a fantastic reading and underscores just how strong the manufacturing sector has been coming out of the pandemic,” said Adam Button, chief currency strategist at Forexlive.com.
Positive for gold prices, inflation pressures are also on the rise.
