The chances of Americans clashing in another Civil War are now higher than ever, said Doug Casey, who noted that in todays’ environment, gold, and gold stocks in particular, have not yet begun to see the highest price peaks.
“So what’s the next bubble, that’s what a speculator has to ask himself, and the answer to that is gold, also commodities in general.
In particular, there’s going to be a super bubble in gold stocks,” Casey told Kitco News.
“This war will be war of secession, because the so-called Red counties and Blue counties should just part company.
That’s political propaganda.
