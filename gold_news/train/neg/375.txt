Our gold cycle indicator supports a cycle bottom when it drops below 100 and enters minimum cycle bottoming.
It reached just 171 in September and never supported a bottom.
Consequently, we continued to predict one final decline in precious metals.
The GCI closed at 142 and should drop below 100 in the coming days.
We are likely approaching a significant low in precious metals.
