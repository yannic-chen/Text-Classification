Daily Swing Chart Technical AnalysisThe main trend is down according to the daily swing chart.
A trade through $1966.10 will change the main trend to up.
This is highly unlikely, but there is room to the upside for a normal 50% to 61.8% of Monday’s sell-off.
The main range is $1690.10 to $2089.20.
Since the main trend is down, sellers could come in on the initial test of this price.
