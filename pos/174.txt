Gold markets have pulled back during the trading session initially on Thursday, as the $1900 level continues to cause a certain amount of support and attention.
Ultimately, the market looks as if it is trying to also dance around the 50 day EMA and try to form some type of bottoming pattern.
From a short-term perspective, we are in a bullish channel, so that of course also is something worth paying attention to.
Gold Price Predictions Video 16.10.20Even if we do break down from here, I think there is plenty of support near the $1850 level, and then of course down at the $1800 level which has been important more than once.
Furthermore, the central banks around the world continue to flood the markets with liquidity and look very likely to continue doing so, so I think ultimately gold does get a bit of a boost.
