Losing 1.0% from last weekend by Wednesday night on the MSCI World Index, global stock markets today saw another rise in Asia while the EuroStoxx 600 index erased almost all of this week's earlier 2.8% drop.
Government bond prices meantime slipped again, pushing up the annual yield offered to new buyers of 10-year US Treasury debt to the highest since early June at 0.86%.
When real US rates last traded at this level – a multi-decade low when reached on 23 July – gold prices were $60 lower than today at $1852.
BMO also expects "aggressive renewable infrastructure policy" in China's 14th five-year plan, adding extra demand for copper wiring.
Gold prices meantime traded 0.7% higher for the week at $1913 per ounce, but showed a £10 and €10 loss from last Friday for UK and Eurozone investors at £1460 and €1611 respectively.
