It’s more likely that the stock market will correct to reflect the worst economic situation in recent times than for market euphoria to continue, this according to Peter Grandich, founder of Peter Grandich & Co.“The stock market is nothing what it was when I started 36 years ago.
Back then, 90% of the trading was general public, people bought it because they wanted to be part owner of a company.
Now, in my opinion, the stock market has become a very sophisticated, highly technology-driven casino,” Grandich said.
Grandich noted that while the equities markets could still go higher, now is not the time to be aggressive in general equities.
Instead, Grandich said that gold has another 25% more upside.
