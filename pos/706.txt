(Kitco News) - Gold and silver both trade 0.09% higher overnight leading into the European open in a pretty lacklustre Asian session.
In terms of news, Bank of Japan's Governor Kuroda says the central bank will not be ending easy monetary policy any time soon.
This is obviously positive for gold but we need to see if the Fed has the same intentions.
Leaks are nothing new but it is important that everyone respects the media embargo period before the central bank has a chance to release the data themselves.
Looking ahead to today's session highlights include UK CPI, EU CPI, Canadian CPI, US building permits, DoE crude oil inventories.
