 (Kitco News) - While the gold market has struggled to find solid footing after falling from August's all-time highs, one fund manager says that growing fiscal imbalances will continue to support long-term gold prices.
Winmill noted that some of the scenarios that governments have for dealing with massive debt burdens include taxation, growth, inflation, or default.
He added that out of all these scenarios, inflation is probably the easiest option, and in that environment, gold will continue to shine as an alternative asset for wealth preservation, he said.
He added that in five years, he expects gold prices will be "substantially higher."
Gold prices dropped more than 5% last month, its worst selloff in four years.
