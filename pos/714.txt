Although it could take a little longer than first expected, Land said that he does see several scenarios where gold prices can push back to all-time highs above $2,000 an ounce.
Looking back at the last bull market, Land said that investors were disappointed that mining companies didn't provide the margins they were expecting.
Land said that he expects gold mining companies will continue to look attractive even in a lower gold price environment.
"There's plenty of room for gold prices to pull back and the industry can still say that they have a healthy market.
"Even if gold prices were to pull back to 1600 companies can still say: 'Hey, we have a great business.'"
