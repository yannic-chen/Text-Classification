It may soon be safe to buy gold.
That's according to Mark Newton, founder of Newton Advisors, who says the precious metal could be a buy on a pullback.
"The weekly trend still looks quite bullish, and one would want to really buy into any sort of pullback we see over the next month."
Analysts forecast an average price of $2,500 next year as part of their bull case for gold.
… I'm looking at about $100 lower, $1,750 down to $1,650, as being a very attractive area to buy gold, and that should coincide with the dollar starting to roll over early next year.
