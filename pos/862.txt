We have been writing for weeks that gold and silver were at critical levels of support.
This morning the selling continues with gold down an additional 28.00 and silver .40.
The levels are: gold $1,800 December futures and $23.00 December silver.
However, after this morning’s early push down to $1,803 gold and $23.08 silver, a dead cat bounce would not be a surprise.
We expect a small bounce but will add to our shorts at 23.5 silver and $1,840 gold.
