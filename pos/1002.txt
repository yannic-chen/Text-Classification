 As bitcoin continues its surge higher, Morris noted that according to his research, seasonal factors support the digital asset during the second and fourth quarters.
"The gold market was pretty hot this summer, so it's not surprising to see the price slip back a bit heading into year-end," he said.
While a lot of investors see bitcoin and gold as competing assets, Morris said that he views them as complimenting assets.
Although gold prices are struggling to find renewed buying interest, Morris reiterated his 10-year target for gold to reach $7,000 an ounce by 2030.
At the same time, because of its volatility, bitcoin prices over the next 10 years could be worth around $4 million.
