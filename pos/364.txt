Equities indices fell more than 3% on Monday, with gold and silver also selling off, as Germany and France resume lockdown measures.
Phil Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures, noted that investors were looking for safety outside of precious metals.
“The Japanese Yen was up and bonds are higher, and what that tells me if gold and silver are down, and those two markets are higher, some people are looking for safety but they’re not looking for it in gold and silver,” Streible said.
“If you have a contested election, chances are fiscal stimulus is not going to come anytime soon at all,” he said.
Long-term fundamentals are still with gold, Streible said.
