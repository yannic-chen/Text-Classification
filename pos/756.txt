Central banks are unlikely to withdraw their support for the economies and financial markets in particular," said analysts at Degussa in a report published Thursday.
Degussa remains cautiously optimistic on gold's long-term potential, even as the precious metal currently struggles to attract new investors.
In the report, the precious metals firm said it sees gold prices rising to $2,500 an ounce by mid-2021.
It is against this backdrop that the relative attractiveness of holding gold from an investor's viewpoint increases," the analysts said.
"The purchasing power of gold cannot be debased by central banks running the printing presses," they said.
