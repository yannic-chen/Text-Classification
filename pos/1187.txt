 Gold markets have initially pulled back during the trading session on Friday, but then turned around to show some signs of strength again as the $1825 level has offered support for the last three days in a row.
Ultimately, the market is likely to continue seeing more of a “buy on the dips” type of attitude, but that does not mean that we are going to shoot straight up in the air.
Breaking above there, then the market is likely to go looking towards the $1950 level.
Longer-term, I believe that we will revisit the highs again, due to stimulus talks in the United States finally getting solved.
I do not expect this market to suddenly explode to the upside, but I think that this is more of a bit of a choppy upward slope just waiting to happen.
