Gold edged up on Friday on hopes that a U.S. stimulus package would eventually be passed, boosting the metal's appeal as an inflation hedge, although a stronger dollar capped gains.
Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,906.29 per ounce by 0405 GMT, after slipping more than 1% in the previous session.
Gold has risen over 26% this year benefiting from massive stimulus by governments and major central banks to cushion economies from the pandemic.
Limiting gold's gains, the dollar index rose 0.1% on Friday against a basket of major currencies.
Market focus now shifts to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election after President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden offered sharply contrasting views on the pandemic at Thursday's final presidential debate.
