Gold bulls say that fresh prospects for coronavirus relief may be offering some renewed support for buying precious metals.
On Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY., said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had agreed to restart negotiations over a new coronavirus aid relief package.
Gold pared losses following Schumer’s stimulus restart announcement and then moved up sharply after Mnuchin confirmed fiscal stimulus negations will restart, wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.
However, Jeff Wright, executive vice president of GoldMining Inc., suggested that gold is set to benefit even if stimulus negotiations don’t happen soon.
He told MarketWatch there is “little hope” that Mnuchin and McConnell will restart stimulus talks with Pelosi, and “serious doubt” that Democrats will compromise before January.
