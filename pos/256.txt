Gold markets have initially pulled back a bit during the trading session on Wednesday, only to turn around a break above the $1900 level.
With that being the case, the market is likely to continue to see a lot of interest in this area, and of course the US dollar is greatly influential on what happens in the gold market anyway.
With the US dollar losing a little bit of a ground on the Wednesday session, that does drive gold up a bit.
I think that is the market will look at that through the prism of “market memory”, meaning that there will be plenty of interest.
I think that a pullback towards that area is very possible, perhaps in some type of surge higher when it comes to the US dollar.
