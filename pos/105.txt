Gold Market Commentary for Thursday October 1st, 2020 (www.golddealer.com)By Richard Schwary of California Numismatic Investments Inc ……Gold closed up $20.90 at $1,908.40 today in another surprising shift to the upside.
This past Monday gold closed higher by $15.10 at $1,872.80.
As the US recovers from the pandemic and massive stimulus numbers create inflation and financial imbalance the dollar will weaken supporting higher gold prices.
The key here is waiting on the bigger picture to unfold and noting that in the short term many world currencies suffer from monetary abuse – lose value and in turn support higher gold prices.
On the day gold closed higher by $20.90 at $1,908.40 and silver was up $0.76 at $24.25.
