In a report published earlier this week, Hansen noted that markets could see a Biden victory as more inflationary, and that is what will ultimately propel gold prices higher.
He noted that investment demand remained strong through September even as prices saw a sharp decline.
Driving the demand for gold is the fact that real yields will continue to fall as the Federal Reserve holds interest rates at the zero-bound range in an environment of rising inflation.
Although Hansen sees potential for gold prices to go higher, he added that it is too early to tell if the precious metal can regain the $2,000 level.
He said that a lot of investors could be waiting on the sidelines for the election dust to settle before jumping back into the market.
