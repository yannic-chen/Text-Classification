Looking at something generally sturdy in the market, gold prices have actually been coming under pressure ever since the recent Covid-19 vaccine announcement.
ETF Trends’ CIO and Director of Research, Dave Nadig, and CEO and Founder of GraniteShares, Will Rhind, spoke on “ETF Edge,” with CNBC host Eric Chemi about the prospects of gold, following Citigroup’s bullish issue of a $2,500 target for gold.
To address where gold ETFs may be headed going into the new year, Rhind believes they are going higher.
So there are these big macro drivers, and at the same time, the fundamental microeconomic structure of the gold market is bullish as well.
As far as this $2,500 target, Nadig believes these are the sort of production that don’t need to have much attention given to them.
