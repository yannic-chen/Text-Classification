Gold Price Predictions Video 20.11.20If we managed to break down below the $1800 level it could change some things but right now, I think that is going to be very unlikely.
After all, central banks around the world continue to flood the markets with liquidity so given enough time it is likely that hard assets such as gold will continue to go higher.
(Semantics, I know but at the end of the day this is the same argument I make for Bitcoin right now.)
