Despite the upturn in the global economic outlook following multiple coronavirus vaccine breakthroughs, gold's bullish cycle will continue, according to analysts at Citi and Goldman Sachs.
The traditional safe haven asset hit an all-time high in August of $2,074.88 per ounce, amid fears that the coronavirus crisis looked set to continue indefinitely.
Spot gold was trading down over 1.7% at just under $1,805 per ounce during afternoon trade in Europe on Tuesday.
Despite this, analysts on Wall Street do not expect the downward trend to continue.
Gold last traded above this level in late August.
