 Gold rose by more than 1% on Tuesday, driven by market expectations of additional economic support as COVID-19 cases climbed ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting.
Spot gold was up 1.1% at $1,846.61 per ounce, while U.S. gold futures rose 1% to $1,850.10.
"It is pretty dire in Europe, Asia, South Korea, Japan and the U.S., driving some stimulus expectations and giving (gold) a bit of push," Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen said.
Expectations of a U.S. fiscal stimulus were lifted as President-elect Joe Biden won the Electoral College vote, while lawmakers remained optimistic over a fiscal stimulus deal, pushing the U.S. dollar to languish near multi-year lows.
Silver jumped 1.8% to $24.24 an ounce, platinum rose 1% to $1,017 and palladium gained 1.3% to $2,321.46.
