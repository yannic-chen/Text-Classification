 Gold markets initially tried to rally during the trading session on Wednesday but struggled at the 50 day EMA as we await the Federal Reserve meeting and of course whether or not there is going to be more stimulus.

Gold Price Predictions Video 17.12.20At this juncture, I believe that the market will continue to go back and forth until we get some type of clarity.
Once we do, the gold market will probably take off and move rather quickly.
If we can break above the 50 day EMA and if we get enough stimulus, it is likely that the gold market will go looking towards the $1900 level.
