It appears that both gold and stock market investors believe the winner of the US election (held today) will be more money printing and debt.
That produces corporate earnings and revenues which benefit the stock market.
If the Fed were to curtail its handouts (QE and rate cuts) while the government continues theirs, the stock market could stagnate while gold would continue to rally.
The bottom line:From both a risk and potential reward perspective, gold looks like the best asset to own going into 2021.
For example, after an enormous rally that began in March, a classic three-wave reaction has occurred from the August peak.
