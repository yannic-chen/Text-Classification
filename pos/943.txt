(Kitco News)- Harry Dent, founder of HS Dent, is calling for gold to see its final rally to $2,200 an ounce next year before falling to multi-year lows.
“From 2022 on, I’d be buying gold hand in fist, it’s going to hold up better than most commodities,” he said.
Gold has a strong correlation to inflation and importantly, inflation expectations.
Once that happens, forecasts for $5,000 gold become possible, but gold will unlikely see such levels until at least 2038, Dent said.
During the next two years while gold deflates in value, high quality bonds, like Treasuries and AAA corporate bonds, are expected to outperform, Dent said.
