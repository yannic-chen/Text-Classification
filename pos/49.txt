"In (the) event of uncertainty over the U.S. election and the Covid-19 pandemic, gold is a very, very good hedge.
SINGAPORE — Investors should be putting their money in gold now, as it represents a "very good hedge" ahead of risk events such as the U.S. election, UBS Global Wealth Management told CNBC.
Gold prices have shot to record highs this year — and surpassed $2,000 per ounce for the first time in history.
The precious metal is also attractive due to the low interest rate environment, Tay pointed out.
If interest rates stay low as the Fed has indicated, the opportunity cost of holding gold — a non-yielding asset — will be "quite low," he added.
